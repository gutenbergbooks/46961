<p class="box center">A MON VIEIL AMI LE COMMANDANT
CHARLES LEMAIRE, ACTUELLEMENT DIRECTEUR DE
L’INSTITUT SUPÉRIEUR COLONIAL À ANVERS</p>


<p>
<span class="smcap">Mon Cher Commandant</span>,
</p>

<p>Vous souvenez-vous encore de la visite que je vous fis
l’été dernier aux Sources Fraîches, après les cinq années
tragiques que nous avons vécues?</p>

<p>Je m’en souviens encore comme si c’était hier. Vous
étiez souffrant; je vous ai trouvé étendu, accablé,
affaibli, et je ressens encore la peine profonde que
j’éprouvai à cette minute précise où le contraste s’imposait
à mon esprit entre l’état dans lequel je vous avais
quitté en 1914 et celui dans lequel je vous retrouvais.</p>

<p>Mais cette impression première, dont je garderai
toujours un souvenir ému, fut brève. Vous me parliez
de votre nouvel ouvrage, traitant de l’enseignement
rationnel, et développiez la conception qui en forme la
base. A mesure que vous avanciez, vous vous laissiez
emporter par votre sujet et, redressé, vous parliez avec
l’ardeur et le feu que je vous ai toujours connus, scandant
vos phrases de gestes énergiques et puissants. Je
retrouvais en vous le soldat d’avant-garde enthousiaste
et fort, tout vibrant de foi et de conviction, que vous
n’avez jamais cessé d’être.</p>

<p>La nature, disiez-vous, est une source féconde d’enseignement
et de méthode; elle est la seule institutrice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
des noirs. Ceux-ci, dans les matières se rapportant à la
vie primitive&mdash;et dont une partie correspond à celles
que l’on enseigne aux blancs&mdash;sont, mieux que nous,
naturellement dans le vrai, dans le vrai expérimental.
Longuement vous développiez votre thèse, l’appuyant
de nombreuses constatations de faits récoltées pendant
vos longues années d’observation en plein cœur de
l’Afrique.</p>

<p>Je vous ai écouté longuement et, en vous quittant,
je me suis retrouvé dans ce décor que vous avez choisi
pour y concentrer votre attention sur les problèmes
auxquels vous avez voulu trouver une solution; je me
suis retrouvé dans cette Fagne immense et admirable,
au milieu de ces bruyères aux colorations chaudes, sur
cette terre aux vastes horizons frangés de sapinières, et,
seul en face de la nature, de cette source éternelle dont
vous m’aviez parlé avec tant d’enthousiasme, j’entendais
vos dernières paroles résonner encore à mes oreilles....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Le jour même j’écrivis le premier chapitre de ce livre.
Vous y retrouverez vos propres paroles et l’écho qu’elles
ont éveillé en moi.</p>

<p>La nature doit-elle être notre guide? Oui, sans aucun
doute. Doit-elle être notre seul guide? Sans aucun
doute encore, non. La nature doit, disiez-vous, être
notre inspiratrice; nous devons, grâce à nos capacités
acquises, appliquer les leçons qu’elle nous donne en
utilisant les forces qui sont inhérentes à l’être humain.</p>

<p>Comment passer du principe à son application? Dans
quelle mesure faut-il puiser à la source naturelle, faire
agir l’intelligence humaine et se servir de ses forces
‘subconscientes’?</p>

<p>C’était le point de départ du livre que voici....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>J’ai écrit, il y a quelques années, un livre, <cite lang="en" xml:lang="en">The
Scientific Study and Teaching of Languages</cite>, auquel
j’avais donné la forme d’une étude soulevant des questions
nouvelles, sujettes à controverse et montrant
qu’en réalité la science de l’étude des langues n’existait
pas et qu’il était grand temps de rassembler les matériaux
et les études permettant de lui donner un point de départ
sérieux. Ce livre traitait de la nature du langage et du
processus de l’acquisition des langues ainsi que des divers
types d’étudiants et de leurs buts respectifs; il posait
des principes et présentait un ‘programme-type idéal’
avec des modèles de leçons et un catalogue complet
des méthodes de travail; il examinait longuement
les programmes spéciaux, les fonctions du professeur; il
envisageait les problèmes au point de vue de l’élève et,
après cet ensemble d’études, il concluait par un appel à
l’unité et à la coopération de tous.</p>

<p>Cet appel n’est pas resté sans réponse, et je suis heureux
d’exprimer ici ma satisfaction pour les avis et les encouragements
que m’a valus mon travail. Il m’a gagné
de nombreux amis et collaborateurs; il m’a mis en
contact avec des ‘samideani’ (s’il m’est permis de me
servir d’un des mots les plus connus des langues artificielles)
et m’a ainsi montré d’où pourra venir l’aide
prochaine.</p>

<p>Je suis heureux du secours que ce livre a apporté à
ceux qui en sentaient le besoin, et c’est pour moi un
précieux encouragement de savoir qu’il en est beaucoup
qui travaillent dans la voie qui vient d’être ouverte.</p>

<p>Le livre que je présente aujourd’hui ne couvre pas le
même champ que le précédent. Ce n’est ni une étude,
ni une série de problèmes avec leurs solutions. C’est un
exposé de faits, présumant que le lecteur admet, comme je
les ai admis moi-même, les principes fondamentaux du<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
langage et de l’étude des langues. Ce nouvel ouvrage se
borne à exposer les principes essentiels que sont tenus
d’observer ceux qui veulent enseigner&mdash;ou étudier&mdash;avec
succès.</p>

<p>Il est vrai que dans <cite  lang="en" xml:lang="en">The Scientific Study and Teaching
of Languages</cite> j’ai consacré soixante pages à l’examen de
certains principes, mais quelques années ont passé
depuis que j’ai écrit ces lignes, et pas mal de choses qui
semblaient vagues à cette époque se sont précisées et
développées. Si je n’ai rien, ou peu de chose, à retrancher
de ce travail, j’ai par contre beaucoup à
ajouter et à revoir.</p>

<p>J’ai voulu présenter la matière de mon nouvel ouvrage
dans un ordre plus rigoureux que celui de l’étude précédente,
bien qu’en lui-même le nouveau livre soit moins
technique et que la terminologie en soit moins spéciale.
En réalité, le sujet traité, comme tous les sujets d’ailleurs,
se présente plus simplement après une période de réflexion
et d’incubation, et la forme actuelle a pour but précisément
de réaliser une présentation populaire.</p>

<p>Certains, j’en suis sûr, estimeront que mon ouvrage
n’est pas assez technique. Plusieurs amis m’ont suggéré
avec insistance de présenter le sujet au seul point de
vue de la psychologie, d’autres de me servir exclusivement
de termes scientifiques. Mais je n’ai pas pu me
rallier à aucune de ces propositions parce que j’ai dû
tenir compte de ce que mes lecteurs ne sont pas tous
versés dans “la terminologie psychologique.”</p>

<p>Au surplus, je sens que le sujet n’est pas mûr pour
subir une analyse détaillée envisagée sous l’angle de
la psychologie pure. De plus compétents que moi la
tenteront peut-être quand le moment sera venu. Pour
l’instant, cette étude n’apporterait pas l’aide pratique et
immédiate que j’espère avoir réalisée dans les pages qui<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
suivent, et dont le besoin se fait sentir chez tous ceux qui
s’occupent de l’enseignement des langues.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Je tiens à exprimer aussi ma reconnaissance à ceux
qui m’ont aidé dans la préparation de ce travail. La
collaboration de M. Morris Ginsberg (de University
College, Londres) concernant “la formation et l’adaptation
des habitudes” a été si précieuse que je ne puis
m’empêcher de la souligner tout spécialement; j’espère
qu’il approuvera la présentation de ce sujet particulier.
Les vues de M. H. Perera (de University College,
Londres) sur la “parole intérieure” m’ont également
été fort utiles. Je dois des remerciements à Mrs Powers
(<span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Kingsmead Training Institution for Missionary Candidates</span>),
qui s’est chargée d’examiner le manuscrit phrase
par phrase au point de vue de la clarté et de la
précision.</p>

<p>A présent, mon cher Commandant, permettez-moi
de conclure: une idée que vous avez exprimée à un
moment propice a déclanché chez moi un ordre de
pensées qui m’a conduit à écrire l’ouvrage que je
présente aujourd’hui, et que je suis heureux de vous
dédier.</p>

<h2><a id="SYNOPSIS"></a>SYNOPSIS</h2>


<h3>1. <span class="smcap">We possess Natural or Spontaneous
Capacities for acquiring Speech</span></h3>

<p>In order to become proficient in most arts, we are
assumed to study, <i>i.e.</i> to make conscious efforts persistently
and perseveringly; we are assumed to use our
intelligence. There is, however, one complex art in
which all of us have become proficient without any such
process and without using our intelligence consciously,
viz. <em>the art of speech</em>, <i>i.e.</i> of using the spoken form of a
language as actually used in everyday life. We are
endowed by nature with capacities for assimilating
speech. Each of us is a living testimony to this fact, for
each of us has successfully acquired that form of our
mother-tongue with which we have been in contact.
These capacities are not limited to the acquiring of our
mother-tongue, but are also available for one or more
languages in addition. The young child possesses these
capacities in an active state; consequently he picks up a
second or a third language in the same manner as he does
the first. The adult possesses these same capacities,
but generally in a latent state; by disuse he has
allowed them to lapse. If he wishes, he may re-educate
these powers and raise them to the active state; he will
then by this means become as capable as the child of
assimilating foreign languages. Those adults who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
maintained these powers in an active state are said to
have a gift for languages.</p>


<h3>2. <span class="smcap">Our Studial Capacities and how to
use them</span></h3>

<p>In addition to certain <em>spontaneous</em> capacities, we
possess what we may term ‘<em>studial</em>’ capacities for language-acquisition.
These must be utilized when we
learn how to <em>read</em> and <em>write</em> a language, and also when
we wish to learn forms of language not actually used
in everyday speech (<i>i.e.</i> the literary, oratorical, or ceremonious
forms). The methods by which we utilize
these capacities are generally characterized by <em>conscious</em>
work (such as analysis and synthesis) and by conversion,
<i>i.e.</i> converting written into spoken (reading aloud),
converting spoken into written (dictation), converting
from one language into another (translation), or converting
one grammatical form into another (conjugation,
declension, etc.). All exercises requiring the use of the
eyes and the hand are of the studial order, as are also
those connected with accidence and derivation.</p>

<p>Most of those forms of work by which we utilize or
adapt habits which we acquired previously while learning
some other language (generally the mother-tongue) are
more or less studial forms of work.</p>

<p>Most language-learners at the present day are found
to make an almost exclusive use of their studial capacities,
and in doing so use methods which are more or less
unnatural.</p>


<h3>3. <span class="smcap">Why we must use our Studial Capacities</span></h3>

<p>We must not conclude from the foregoing that
methods involving the use of our capacities for study
are necessarily bad, nor that those based on our spontaneous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
capacities are necessarily always to be used. In
certain cases and for certain purposes we shall be forced
to use the former. Nature alone will not teach us how
to read or write; for these purposes we must use our
studial capacities. We shall, however, refrain from
reading or writing any given material until we have
learnt to use the spoken form. Nature will not teach us
how to use forms of language which are not currently
used in everyday speech; in order to acquire these we
must have recourse to our powers of study; thus we shall
use these powers when learning literary composition, the
language of ceremony, etc. Moreover, the studial powers
must be utilized for the purposes for which a <em>corrective
course</em> is designed. What has been badly assimilated
must be eliminated consciously; bad habits can only be
replaced by good habits through processes unknown to
the language-teaching forces of nature. Even those
who have not been previously spoiled by defective study
require a certain amount of corrective work in order
that they may react against the tendency to import into
the new language some of the characteristic features of
the previously acquired language or languages.</p>

<p>Some students have no desire to <em>use</em> the foreign language,
but merely wish to learn about it, to know
something of its structure. In such cases no attempt
whatever need be made to develop or to utilize their
spontaneous language-learning capacities; they may
work exclusively by the methods of study.</p>


<h3>4. <span class="smcap">The Student and his Aim</span></h3>

<p>We cannot design a language course until we know
something about the students for whom the course is
intended, for a programme of study depends on the aim
or aims of the students. All we can say in advance is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
that we must endeavour to utilize the most appropriate
means to attain the desired end. A course which is
suitable in one case may prove unsuitable in another.
Some students may require only a knowledge of the
written language, others are concerned with the spoken
language, others desire to become conversant with both
aspects. Some students only require a superficial
knowledge, while others aim at a perfect knowledge.
Special categories of learners (<i>e.g.</i> clerks, hotel-keepers,
tourists, grammarians) wish to specialize. The sole aim
of some students is to pass a given examination; others
wish to become proficient as translators or interpreters.</p>

<p>The length of the course or programme is a most
important determining factor; a two months’ course
will differ fundamentally from one which is designed to
last two years; the former will be a preparatory course,
the latter will be highly developed.</p>

<p>It will not be possible for us to design a special course
for each individual, still less to write a special text-book
for him; we can, however, broadly group our students
into types, and recommend for each type the most
appropriate forms of work. In any case, the teacher is
bound to draw up some sort of programme in advance
and to divide this into stages appropriately graded.
This programme must not be of the rigid type, the same
for all requirements; it should be designed on an elastic
basis and should be in accordance with known pedagogical
principles.</p>


<h3>5. <span class="smcap">The Supreme Importance of the
Elementary Stage</span></h3>

<p>The reader of this book may notice, perhaps with
some surprise, how much we have to say concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the work of the beginner, and how little we say about
the more advanced work; he may be puzzled at the
amount of attention we pay to (what he may consider)
crude elementary work compared with the amount we
give to (what he may consider) the more complex and
interesting work connected with the higher stages. It
will therefore be useful, at this point, to anticipate what
will be more fully dealt with under the heading of
gradation (<a href="#CHAPTER_X">Chapter X</a>), and insist here already on the
supreme importance of the elementary stage.</p>

<p>Language-study is essentially a habit-forming process,
and the important stage in habit-forming is the elementary
stage. If we do not secure habits of accurate
observation, reproduction, and imitation during the
first stage, it is doubtful whether we shall ever secure
them subsequently. It is more difficult to unlearn a
thing than to learn it. If the elementary stage is gone
through without due regard to the principles of study, the
student will be caused to do things which he must subsequently
undo; he will acquire habits which will have
to be eradicated. If his ear-training is neglected during
the elementary stage, he will replace foreign sounds by
native ones and insert intrusive sounds into the words
of the language he is learning; he will become unable to
receive any but eye-impressions, and so will become the
dupe of unphonetic orthographies. If he has not been
trained during the elementary stage to cultivate his
powers of unconscious assimilation and reproduction, he
will attempt the hopeless task of passing all the language-matter
through the channel of full consciousness. If
during the elementary stage he forms the ‘isolating
habit,’ he will not be able to use or to build accurate
sentences. An abuse of translation during the elementary
stage will cause the student to translate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
mentally everything he hears, reads, says, or writes.
Bad habits of articulation will cause him to use language
of an artificialized type.</p>

<p>The function of the elementary stage is to inculcate
good habits, and once this work is done there is little
or no fear of the student going astray in his later work.
If we take care of the elementary stage, the advanced
stage will take care of itself.</p>


<h3>6. <span class="smcap">The Principles of Language-teaching</span></h3>

<p>The art of designing a language course appears to be
in its infancy. Those arts which have achieved maturity
have gradually evolved from a number of distinct
primitive efforts which, by a process of gradual convergence
towards each other, have resulted in the ideal
type. So will it be in the art of composing language
courses: the present diverse types will gradually be
replaced by more general types, and in the end the ideal
type will be evolved. This will come about as a result
of a system of collaboration in which each worker will
profit by that which has been done in the past and that
which is being done by other workers in the present.
Unsound methods will gradually be eliminated and will
make room for methods which are being evolved slowly
and experimentally and which will pass the tests of
experience. By this time a series of essential principles
will have been discovered, and these will be recognized
as standard principles by all whose work is to design
language courses.</p>

<p>The following list would seem to embody some of
these, and probably represents principles on which there
is general agreement among those who have made a
study of the subject:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>(1) The initial preparation of the student by the
training of his spontaneous capacities for assimilating
spoken language.</p>

<p>(2) The forming of new and appropriate habits and
the utilization of previously formed habits.</p>

<p>(3) Accuracy in work in order to prevent the acquiring
of bad habits.</p>

<p>(4) Gradation of the work in such a way as to ensure
an ever-increasing rate of progress.</p>

<p>(5) Due proportion in the treatment of the various
aspects and branches of the subject.</p>

<p>(6) The presentation of language-material in a concrete
rather than in an abstract way.</p>

<p>(7) The securing and maintaining of the student’s
interest in order to accelerate his progress.</p>

<p>(8) A logical order of progression in accordance with
principles of speech-psychology.</p>

<p>(9) The approaching of the subject simultaneously
from different sides by means of different and appropriate
devices.</p>


<h3>7. <span class="smcap">Initial Preparation</span></h3>

<p>We must realize that language-learning is an art, not a
science. We may acquire proficiency in an art in two
ways: by learning the theory, or by a process of imitation.
This latter process is often termed the method of <em>trial
and error</em>, but as the term may be misinterpreted it is
better to consider it as the method of <em>practice</em>. The
method of practice is a natural one, the method of
theory is not. We may acquire proficiency in two ways:
by forming appropriate new habits, or by utilizing and
adapting appropriate old habits (<i>i.e.</i> habits already
acquired). The natural process is the former, the latter
being more or less artificial. Language-study is essentially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
a habit-forming process, so we must learn to form
habits. By the natural or spontaneous method we learn
unconsciously; we must therefore train ourselves or our
students to form habits unconsciously.</p>

<p>The adult whose natural capacities for unconscious
habit-forming have been dormant may reawaken them
by means of appropriate exercises. These are notably:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Ear-training exercises</i>, by means of which he may
learn to perceive correctly what he hears.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Articulation exercises</i>, by means of which he may
cause his vocal organs to make the right sort of muscular
efforts.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Exercises in mimicry</i>, by means of which he will
become able to imitate and reproduce successfully any
word or string of words uttered by the native whose
speech serves as model.</p>

<p>(The combination of the three foregoing types of
exercise will result in the capacity for reproducing at
first hearing a string of syllables, such as a sentence.
The student will thereby become enabled to memorize
unconsciously the <em>form</em> of speech.)</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Exercises in immediate comprehension</i>, by means
of which he will come to grasp without mental translation
or analysis the general sense of what he hears.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>Exercises in forming the right associations between
words and their meanings</i>, by means of which he will
become able to express his thoughts.</p>

<p>The combination of these five types of exercise will
develop the student’s capacity to use spoken language.</p>


<h3>8. <span class="smcap">Habit-forming and Habit-adapting</span></h3>

<p>Language-study is essentially a habit-forming process.
We speak and understand automatically as the result of
perfectly formed habits. No foreign word or sentence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
is really ‘known’ until the student can produce it
automatically (<i>i.e.</i> without hesitation or conscious
calculation). No one can understand by any process
of calculation (<i>e.g.</i> translation or analysis) the language
as spoken normally by the native. Few people (if any)
have ever succeeded in speaking the language by a
series of mental gymnastics; our progress is to be
measured only by the quantity of language-material
which we can use automatically. Adult students
generally dislike the work of acquiring new habits, and
seek to replace it by forms of study dependent upon
the intellect, striving to justify their abstention from
mechanical work on educational grounds. This fear
of tediousness is really groundless; automatism is
certainly acquired by repetition, but this need not be of
the monotonous, parrot-like type, for there exist many
psychologically sound repetition devices and varied drills
intended to ensure automatism and interest.</p>

<p>Most of the time spent by the teacher in demonstrating
<em>why</em> a foreign sentence is constructed in a particular
way is time wasted; it is generally enough for the student
to learn to do things without learning why he must do
them (due exception being made in special cases, notably
that of corrective courses).</p>

<p>The student should not only be caused to form new
habits; he should also be helped, when expedient, to
utilize some of his existing habits; it is even part of the
teacher’s duties to aid the student to select from his
previously acquired habits those which are likely to be of
service to him.</p>


<h3>9. <span class="smcap">Accuracy</span></h3>

<p>Accuracy means <em>conformity with a given model or
standard</em>, whatever that model or standard may happen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to be. If we choose to take colloquial French or colloquial
English as our standard, the forms pertaining to
classical French or English (<i>i.e.</i> traditionally correct
forms) are to be rejected as inaccurate. There are two
types of inaccuracy: that in which a colloquial form is
replaced by a classical form and <i>vice versa</i>, and that in
which a native form is replaced by a pidgin form. In
both cases the teacher’s duty is to react against the
tendency towards inaccuracy.</p>

<p>Appropriate drills and exercises exist which ensure
accuracy in sounds, stress, intonation, fluency, spelling,
sentence-building and -compounding, inflexions, and
meanings.</p>

<p>The principle of accuracy requires that <em>the student shall
have no opportunities for making mistakes until he has
arrived at the stage at which accurate work is reasonably to be
expected</em>.</p>

<p>If we compel a student to utter foreign words before
he has learnt how to make the requisite foreign sounds,
if we compel him to write a composition in a foreign
language before he has become reasonably proficient in
sentence-building, or if we compel him to talk to us in
the foreign language before he has done the necessary
drill-work, we are compelling him to use the pidgin
form of the language.</p>

<p>In addition to specific exercises and devices which
ensure accuracy in special points, we should observe
certain general rules which will be described and treated
under the heading of gradation.</p>


<h3>10. <span class="smcap">Gradation</span></h3>

<p>Gradation means passing from the known to the unknown
by easy stages, each of which serves as a prepara<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>tion
for the next. If a course or a lesson is insufficiently
graded, or graded on a wrong basis, the student’s work
will be marked by an excessive degree of inaccuracy.
If a course is well graded, the student’s rate of progress
will increase in proportion as he advances.</p>

<p>In the ideally graded course the student is caused
to assimilate perfectly a relatively small but exceedingly
important vocabulary; when perfectly assimilated,
this nucleus will develop and grow in the manner of a
snowball.</p>

<p>Care should be taken to distinguish between false
grading and sound grading. The following applications
of this principle are psychologically sound:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Ears before Eyes.</i>&mdash;The student to be given ample
opportunities, at appropriate intervals, of hearing a
sound, a word, or a group of words before seeing them
in their written form (phonetic or other).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Reception before Reproduction.</i>&mdash;The student to be
given ample opportunities, with appropriate intervals, of
hearing a sound or combination of sounds, a word, or a
group of words before being called upon to imitate what
he hears.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Oral Repetition before Reading.</i>&mdash;The student to be
given ample opportunities of repeating matter after the
teacher before being called upon to read the same matter.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Immediate Memory before Prolonged Memory.</i>&mdash;The
student should not be required to reproduce matter heard
a long time previously until he has become proficient in
reproducing what he has just heard.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>Chorus-work before Individual Work.</i>&mdash;In the case of
classes, new material should be repeated by the whole
of the students together before each student is called
upon to repeat individually. This will tend to ensure
confidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) <i>Drill-work before Free Work.</i>&mdash;The student should
not be given opportunities for free conversation, free
composition, or free translation until he has acquired
a reasonable proficiency in the corresponding forms of
drill-work.</p>

<p>Each individual item in the teaching should be graded,
and in addition the whole course may be graded by
dividing it into appropriate stages or phases, which will
succeed each other <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en échelon</i>.</p>


<h3>11. <span class="smcap">Proportion</span></h3>

<p>The ultimate aim of most students is fourfold:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) To understand what is said in the foreign language
when it is spoken rapidly by natives.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) To speak the foreign language in the manner of
natives.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) To understand the language as written by natives.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) To write the language in the manner of natives.</p>

<p>We observe the principle of proportion when we pay
the right amount of attention to each of these four aspects,
without exaggerating the importance of any of them.</p>

<p>There are five chief branches of practical linguistics:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Phonetics</i>, which teaches us to recognize and to
reproduce sounds and tones.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Orthography</i>, which teaches us to spell what we
have already learnt by ear.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Accidence and etymology</i>, which teaches us the
nature of inflected forms and derivatives, and also how
to use them.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Syntax and analysis</i>, which teaches us how to
build up sentences from their components.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>Semantics</i>, which teaches us the meanings of words
and forms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>We observe the principle of proportion when we pay
the right amount of attention to each of these five
branches, without exaggerating the importance of any
of them.</p>

<p>In choosing the units of our vocabulary we may be
guided by several considerations, such as intrinsic
utility, sentence-forming utility, grammatical function,
regularity, facility, concreteness, or completeness. We
observe the principle of proportion when we select
the material of our vocabularies in such a way that
due attention is paid to all such desiderata, and without
exaggerating the importance of any of them.</p>

<p>We also observe the principle of proportion when we
give the right amount of drill-work or free work, of
translation-work or ‘direct’ work, of intensive reading
or extensive reading. A well-proportioned course, like a
well-graded course, ensures a steady and ever-increasing
rate of progress.</p>


<h3>12. <span class="smcap">Concreteness</span></h3>

<p>We are enjoined by the principle of concreteness to
teach more by example than by precept. When we
give explanations we should illustrate these by striking
and vivid examples embodying the point of theory
which is the subject of our explanation. One example
is generally not enough; it is by furnishing several
examples bearing on the same point that we cause the
student to grasp that which is common to them all.</p>

<p>But this is not enough: the examples themselves may
vary in concreteness; therefore we should select for our
purpose those which demonstrate in the clearest possible
way the point we are teaching and which tend to form
the closest semantic associations. We should utilize
as far as possible the actual environment of the student:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the grammar of the noun is best understood when we
talk of books, pencils, and chairs; the grammar of the
verb is best grasped when we choose as examples verbs
which can be ‘acted’; <i>black</i>, <i>white</i>, <i>round</i>, <i>square</i> are
more concrete adjectives than <i>rich</i>, <i>poor</i>, <i>idle</i>, <i>diligent</i>.</p>

<p>There are four ways of teaching the meanings of words
or forms:</p>

<p>(1) <i>By immediate association</i>, as when we point to the
object represented by a noun.</p>

<p>(2) <i>By translation</i>, as when we give the student the
nearest native equivalent.</p>

<p>(3) <i>By definition</i>, as when we describe the unit by
means of a synonymous expression.</p>

<p>(4) <i>By context</i>, as when we embody the word or
expression in a sentence which will make its meaning
clear.</p>

<p>These four manners are given here in what is generally
their order of concreteness; it is interesting to note
in this connexion that translation is not nearly so
‘indirect’ or ‘unconcrete’ as the extreme ‘direct
methodists’ have led us to suppose.</p>

<p>It is for the teacher to judge under what conditions
each of these four manners of teaching meanings may be
appropriately used.</p>


<h3>13. <span class="smcap">Interest</span></h3>

<p>No work is likely to be successfully accomplished if the
student is not interested in what he is doing, but in our
efforts to interest the pupil we must take care that the
quality of the teaching does not suffer. Habit-forming
work has the reputation of being dull and tedious. The
remedy, however, would not be to abandon it in favour
of work which in itself is or seems more interesting
(such as reading, composition, and translation exercises),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
for by so doing we should merely be leaving undone work
which must be done. The true remedy is to devise a
number of varied and appropriate exercises in order to
make the habit-forming work itself interesting.</p>

<p>The most ingenious and interesting arithmetical
problems alone will not assist the student in memorizing
the multiplication table, and the most ingenious and
interesting sentence-building devices alone will not cause
the student to obtain the necessary automatic command
of the fundamental material of the language.</p>

<p>There are notably six factors making for interest (and
the observing of these will not in any appreciable degree
violate the eight other principles involved), viz.:</p>

<p>(1) <i>The Elimination of Bewilderment.</i>&mdash;Difficulty is one
thing: bewilderment is another. The student must,
in the ordinary course of events, be confronted with
difficulties, but he should never be faced with hopeless
puzzles. Rational explanations and good grading will
eliminate bewilderment and, in so doing, will tend to
make the course interesting.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Sense of Progress achieved.</i>&mdash;When the student
feels that he is making progress, he will rarely fail to be
interested in his work.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Competition.</i>&mdash;The spirit of emulation adds zest
to all study.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Game-like Exercises.</i>&mdash;Many forms of exercise so
resemble games of skill that they are often considered as
interesting as chess and similar pastimes.</p>

<p>(5) <i>The Relation between Teacher and Student.</i>&mdash;The
right attitude of the teacher towards his pupils will contribute
largely towards the interest taken in the work.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Variety.</i>&mdash;Change of work generally adds interest:
an alternation of different sorts of monotonous work
makes the whole work less monotonous. Spells of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
drill-work, however, should be relieved by intervals
devoted to work of a less monotonous character.</p>


<h3>14. <span class="smcap">A Rational Order of Progression</span></h3>

<p>Apart from all questions of grading, we may observe
in most of the branches of language-work different
orders of progression. We may proceed from the spoken
to the written or from the written to the spoken: we
may start with ear-training and articulation exercises or
leave them to a later stage: we may treat intonation
as a fundamental or leave it to the final stage: we may
proceed from the sentence to the word or <i>vice versa</i>:
irregularities may be included or excluded during the
first part of the course: we may proceed from rapid
and fluent to slow utterance or <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>Modern pedagogy tends to favour the former of each
of these alternatives: whereas the teachers of the past
generations generally pronounced in favour of the latter.
The ancient school said: First learn how to form words,
then learn how to form sentences, then pay attention
to the ‘idiomatic’ phenomena, and lastly learn how to
pronounce and to speak. The modern school says:
First learn to form sounds, then memorize sentences, then
learn systematically how to form sentences, and lastly
learn how to form words.</p>

<p>The two orders of progression, it will be seen, are
almost directly opposite to each other. We who have
carefully examined and analysed the arguments on either
side are forced to conclude that the modern order is
the rational order, and psychologists will confirm our
conclusion. The old order stands for cramming and for
an erratic and weak curve of progress: the modern order
stands for results which are both immediate and of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
permanent nature. The old order teaches us much
about the language and its theory: the modern order
teaches us how to <em>use</em> a language.</p>


<h3>15. <span class="smcap">The Multiple Line of Approach</span></h3>

<p>This ninth and last of the essential principles of
language-study welds the eight others into a consistent
whole; it harmonizes any seeming contradictions and
enables us to observe in a perfectly rational manner all of
the precepts set forth under their respective headings;
it answers once for all most of those perplexing questions
which have engaged the attention of so many
language-teachers and controversialists for such a long
time.</p>

<p>If this principle is in contradiction to the spirit of
partisanship, it is equally opposed to the spirit of compromise;
it suggests a third and better course, that
of accepting any two or more rival expedients and of
embodying them boldly as separate items in the programme,
in order that each may fulfil its function in a
well-proportioned and well-organized whole.</p>

<p>The term ‘multiple line of approach’ implies that we
are to proceed simultaneously from many different
starting-points towards one and the same end; we
use each and every method, process, exercise, drill, or
device which may further us in our immediate purpose
and bring us nearer to our ultimate goal; we adopt
every good idea and leave the door open for all future
developments; we reject nothing except useless and
harmful forms of work. The multiple line of approach
embodies the eclectic principle (using the term in its
general and favourable sense), for it enjoins us to select
judiciously and without prejudice all that is likely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
help us in our work. Whether our purpose is the complete
mastery of the language in all its aspects and
branches, or whether our purpose is a more special one,
the principle holds good: we adopt the best and most
appropriate means towards the required end.</p>


<h3>16. <span class="smcap">‘Memorized Matter’ and ‘Constructed
Matter’</span></h3>

<p>When more is known about speech-psychology and
the ultimate processes of language-study, it will be
possible to embody as one of the fundamental principles
the following considerations:</p>

<p>The whole of our speech-material is possessed by
us either as ‘memorized matter’ or as ‘constructed
matter.’</p>

<p><em>Memorized matter</em> includes everything which we have
memorized integrally, whether syllables, words, word-groups,
sentences, or whole passages.</p>

<p><em>Constructed matter</em> includes everything not so memorized,
<i>i.e.</i> matter which we compose as we go on, matter
which we build up unit by unit from our stock of memorized
matter while we are speaking or writing.</p>

<p>There are three manners of producing constructed
matter from memorized matter; we may term these
respectively <i>grammatical construction</i>, <i>ergonic construction</i>,
and <i>conversion</i>.</p>

<p><i>Grammatical Construction.</i>&mdash;In this process, our
memorized matter consists of ‘<em>dictionary words</em>’ (<i>i.e.</i>
uninflected and unmodified root-like words). By learning
the theories of accidence, syntax, derivation, and
composition we become (or hope to become) able to
produce constructed matter at will.</p>

<p><i>Ergonic Construction.</i>&mdash;In this process, our memorized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
matter consists of two elements: <em>more or less complete
sentences</em> and ‘<em>working words</em>’ (units of speech ready
inflected, ready modified, ready derived, or ready
compounded), which units may be termed ‘ergons.’
By means of appropriate tables and drill-like forms of
work, from this memorized matter we produce more or
less spontaneously the requisite constructed matter.</p>

<p><i>Conversion.</i>&mdash;In this process, our memorized matter
consists of classified series of sentences which are to be
converted into other forms by means of appropriate
exercises of various kinds.</p>

<p>In the opinion of many, the greatest evil in present-day
methods lies in the fact that an almost exclusive use is
made of the first of these processes as a method of
producing constructed matter. Instead of concentrating
their efforts on condemning this process as a vicious and
unnatural one, the reformers of thirty years ago merely
advocated what has been termed the ‘direct method,’
the chief features of which are the abolition of translation
exercises and of the use of the mother-tongue as a vehicle
of instruction.</p>

<p class="break p4 center x-large">THE PRINCIPLES OF
LANGUAGE-STUDY</p>




<h2 class="nobreak"><a id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="smaller">OUR SPONTANEOUS CAPACITIES FOR
ACQUIRING SPEECH</span></h2>


<p>What do we do in order to become skilful in the
exercise of an art? If we wish to become
proficient in performing an unlimited series
of complicated acts, what course do we adopt in order
to obtain such proficiency? The first answer which
suggests itself is to the effect that such skill or proficiency
is acquired by a process called <em>study</em> or <em>learning</em>.
We learn to do it; we <em>study</em> the art; we follow a course
and all that the course implies; we attend lectures, we
take lessons, we read the text-book containing the
principles (rudimentary or otherwise) which embody the
precepts relating to that art, we perform exercises; in
short, we become <em>students</em>. Very well; let us accept
the answer for what it is worth and proceed to formulate
a series of supplementary questions: What are the
qualities which mark the successful student? What
sort of people are likely to study with success? Of what
people can we predict failure or incapacity for making
progress? Most people will answer: The student
must possess intelligence, assiduity, and perseverance;
if at the same time he should be ‘gifted,’ his progress
will be much greater than the progress of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
who possesses no ‘natural talents’ for learning the
art in question.</p>

<p>This answer, on the face of it, seems a reasonable one
and a right one; it gives us the impression of being in
accordance with the traditions and maxims of the pedagogic
world, and with our experience, either as teachers
or as learners. We think of our efforts (successful or
unsuccessful) to learn shorthand, piano-playing, violin-playing,
singing, chess, typewriting, dancing, drawing,
painting, modelling, carpentering, and a host of
similar subjects; we remember the intensive acts of
analysis and synthesis, the efforts of attention, the
strain of comprehending, the striving to retain; we
remember the hours of solid labour, the exercises,
the drills, the spade-work; we consider the period
of time covered by these continuous efforts, and we
realize the cost at which we have acquired our present
proficiency.</p>

<p>And yet there exists an art, we are told, in which every
one of us has become proficient, an art in which every
man, woman, and child throughout the world is a
skilful adept, an art which has been acquired without
any process resembling study, without lectures or
lessons or text-books or theory, without the exercise
of our powers of conscious or critical reflection, or
analysis, or synthesis, or generalization, without the
giving of our conscious attention, without deliberate
effort or striving.</p>

<p>This art, we are told, requires no intelligence on the
part of the one who is learning it; on the contrary, the
least intelligent often prove to be among the most
successful adepts, notably very young children, idiots, or
barbarians of the lowest scale.</p>

<p>This statement seems so strange on the face of it, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
paradoxical and so contrary to our preconceived notions
concerning the acquiring of knowledge, that we immediately
suspect some ‘catch’; we are inclined to treat as
a joker the one who has so gravely made the statement.
The ‘art’ in question is probably something of an
absurdly rudimentary character, something of such a
simple nature that it neither admits of analysis or
synthesis nor requires any form of logical or co-ordinated
thought. But no, the art in question is one involving
at least three distinct sciences, each of which is so
complex and so vast that the learned world has not yet
succeeded in unravelling it or in sounding its depths.</p>

<p>Convinced by now that we are the object of some
form of ingenious witticism, we ask: What, then, is
this strange art in which the dunce excels, this art
which requires of its adepts neither brains, industry,
nor patience?</p>

<p>The answer is: <em>The art of using the spoken and everyday
form of any given language</em>. Show me the child of
three years of age, the madman, or the savage, who is
not an expert at it!</p>

<p>Let us make sure that we have understood this
answer, in order that we may not misinterpret it, in
order that we may not read into it a meaning which is
not there. In the first place, there is no question here
of <em>reading</em> or <em>writing</em> the language, but of <em>understanding
what is said</em>, and of <em>expressing what we wish to say by
speaking</em>; and the art in question has nothing to do with
alphabets, with letters, with spelling, with calligraphy,
which are artificial developments deliberately invented
by man. Nor is there any question of <em>literary composition</em>
in prose or poetry; we are not dealing with any
æsthetic form, but merely with the ‘everyday’ form,
the colloquial form, the sort of speech we use on ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
occasions in order to express our usual thoughts. Let
there be no mistake on this point: the higher forms
of language, the artistic developments, eloquence or
literature, may interest us, may interest us intensely,
but the particular art of which we are now speaking
is far removed from these heights; we are considering
language as manifested by the normal colloquial
form as used by the average speaker in ordinary
circumstances.</p>

<p>Now there is no doubt whatever that proficiency in
this particular sort of human activity is possessed by
every human being who is not congenitally deaf or dumb;
we are all able to say what we want to say, we are all
able to understand what is said to us provided that the
communication concerns things which are within the
limits of our knowledge. We have acquired this proficiency
not by a course of study as we understand the
term in its ordinary use; we have not learnt it as a
result of lectures or lessons; it has not come as a consequence
of deliberate effort and concentration. Some
of us, in exceptional circumstances, may have availed
ourselves of our intelligence; but in general our intelligence,
our reasoning powers, our capacities for
deduction, for analysis and synthesis, have counted for
nothing in the process.</p>

<p>Might we not then call it a ‘gift’? Did we not
mention specifically that those who have a gift for a
particular art can to a certain extent dispense with the
qualities of intelligence, assiduity, perseverance? There
is no objection against using the term ‘gift,’ provided
that it is clear to our minds that everybody possesses
the gift in question. Usually, however, we understand
by ‘gift’ something ‘given’ to certain individuals only;
consequently we are not in the habit of speaking about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the gift of sight, of hearing, or of locomotion. It would
be safer to avoid the term and to speak rather of our
natural, spontaneous, and universal <em>capacity</em> for using
spoken language.</p>

<p>But are we right as to our facts? Is it true that we
acquire speech by some capacity other than our intelligence,
our reasoning powers? Let our answer be based
on objective and easily proven evidence. A child of two
or three years of age can use the spoken language
appropriate to his age, but what does that child know of
reasoning? And what is its standard of intelligence?
Not enough to cause it to realize or understand that two
and two make four. And yet that child observes with
a marvellous degree of accuracy most of the complicated
laws governing his mother-tongue. And the
savage. By definition he is unintelligent, he has never
learnt to think logically, he has no power of abstraction,
he is probably unaware that such a thing as language
exists; but he will faithfully observe to the finest
details the complexities (phonetic, grammatical, and
semantic) of his ‘savage’ language. He will use the
right vowel or tone in the right place; he will not confuse
any of the dozen or so genders with which his
language is endowed; a ‘savage’ language (with an
accidence so rich that Latin is by comparison a language
of simple structure) will to him be an instrument on
which he plays in the manner of an artist, a master: and
we are speaking of a savage, mark you, whose intelligence
is of so low an order that for him that which is not
concrete has no existence!</p>

<p>In English we have a tone-system so complicated that
no one has so far discovered its laws, but little English
children observe each nicety of tone with marvellous
precision; a learned specialist in ‘tonetics’ (or whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the science of tones will come to be called) may make an
error, but the little child will not. The grammatical
system of the Bantu languages depends largely on
fine shades of intonation; the dropping of the voice a
semitone at certain points in the sentence, for instance,
is an essential feature of their syntax, while the
highly complex system of tone-mutation serves as
a basis of their conjugation and declension; but
no Bechuana or Matabele native, illiterate as he may
be, will ever commit the slightest error in the use of
his tones.</p>

<p>When, therefore, we find that a person has become
expert in a difficult and complex subject, the
theory of which has not yet been worked out, nor
yet been discovered, it is manifest that his expertness
has been acquired otherwise than by the study
of the theory.</p>

<p>Let us furthermore examine what passes in our mind
when we are speaking our own language, and endeavour
to ascertain whether we form our sentences in unconscious
obedience to some rules unknown to us, or whether
we are consciously applying rules we have learnt. Do
you say <i>I go always there</i> or <i>I always go there</i>? You
certainly use the latter form. Why? Have you ever
been told that a certain class of adverbs (among them the
word <i>always</i>) is placed before and not after the verb?
Have you been told that there are twenty-three exceptions
to the rule, and have you ever learnt these
exceptions? It is most probable that you have never
had your attention called to the rule or to its exceptions.
You put <i>always</i> in front of all verbs except the twenty-three
exceptional verb-forms for the very reason for which
the African native puts the right tone on the right
syllable in the right case. In what cases do you replace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the word <i>far</i> by the expression <i>a long way</i>? What are
the precise laws governing the respective uses of <i>went</i> and
<i>did go</i>? Which are the English ‘postpositions,’ if any?
In what cases do we use nouns unpreceded by any
article or other determinative word? What is the exact
difference between <i>had you</i> and <i>did you have</i>? These
are a few odd examples chosen at random out of
the thousands of items the sum of which constitutes
the theory of the structure of the English colloquial
language. Most of them are not contained in any
manual of English grammar nor ever taught as a school
subject.</p>

<p>We are forced to conclude that we have become proficient
in the use of our mother-tongue by some process
other than that of learning by dint of conscious efforts of
reasoning and synthesis.</p>

<p>While granting the above conclusion and recognizing
its validity, some may object that the process of unconscious
assimilation is <em>not</em> sufficient to ensure skill and
proficiency in the use of the language. This objection
may be supported by proofs to the effect that the English
of young children (not to mention adults) is frequently
‘incorrect’ or ‘ungrammatical.’ Can this process of
nature be said to have succeeded when it produces such
results as “Any bloke what don’t do it proper didn’t
ought to come”? Certainly the process has succeeded;
most certainly the natural forces have operated with
perfect success! The only trouble is that users of such
sentences have succeeded in learning a dialect which
most of us agree to consider a deplorable one; this
dialect is to our ears an ugly and a repelling one, but in
itself it is probably no easier to learn than the educated
colloquial. An educated person to whom this dialect
is foreign would probably have to pass a long period of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
study should he wish, for any particular purpose, to
become expert in its use. It is quite a fallacy to suppose
that a debased or vulgar form of speech is of easier
acquisition than the more elevated forms. The language,
dialect, patois, or form of speech taught by nature to the
child (or adult) is that form which he hears spoken by
those about him during the period of acquisition, be it
the stilted speech of the pedant or the jargon of the
slums.</p>

<p>Let us accept the thesis as so far proven; let us agree
that this spontaneous capacity exists, that every child
does become expert in this art, and that his expertness
has been gained by the exercise of some powers
other than those of conscious reflection or reasoning.
But does not this relate solely to the acquisition of
one’s mother-tongue? In the definition of the art in
question the term ‘any given language’ was used.
Do we conclude that this given language is the <em>first</em>
language, or are we assuming that the same process
holds good for any <em>foreign</em> or <em>subsequently learnt</em>
language?</p>

<p>The question is a legitimate one; we may well ask
ourselves whether the forces which were operative in
the case of our first language are available for the
acquisition of a second, third, or fourth language. Let
us, as before, go to the actual facts and collect objective
evidence on the point. What evidence is afforded by
bilingual children, that is to say, by children who
have learnt two languages simultaneously, children of
mixed parentage, children whose care has been entrusted
to foreign nurses, children who live abroad with
their parents? In nearly all the cases of which we have
any record it would appear that the two languages have
been acquired simultaneously without mutual detriment;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
there has been practically no confusion between the two,
and the one has had little or no influence on the other.
Both have been acquired by the natural language-teaching
forces which are at present engaging our
attention.</p>

<p>The next evidence will consist of the testimony
afforded by children who started their second language
after the first had already been acquired as a going
concern. We find almost invariably that the second
language is picked up with the same facility and accuracy
as the first. Thousands of Belgian refugee children
returned to their country in possession of an English
speech hardly to be distinguished from the speech of
English children of their own age. Their first language
had interfered in no way with their power of acquiring
the second. There were, however, exceptions; in some
instances the possession of the first language did interfere
with the proper acquiring of the second. What was
the determining factor? To what was due this differentiation?
We find that in most cases the child was of
a riper age, he had arrived at the age of intelligence, and
had been forced to use his rudimentary intelligence as
a means towards learning English. He was old enough
and clever enough to receive eye-impressions side by
side with ear-impressions. He was old enough to pay
attention, he was intelligent enough to concentrate, he
was skilful enough to analyse and to compare the second
language with his first, he was able to translate. These
things had a harmful influence on his work; they interfered
with the processes by which nature causes us to
assimilate and to remember, and the quality of his
English suffered; it was to a certain extent ‘foreigner’s’
English, whereas his younger brothers spoke ‘English’
English.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>And what happens in the case of the adult, of one
who starts his second language from fifteen to twenty
years after he has acquired the first? The same thing
generally happens as in the last instance quoted, but in
a more marked degree. The same interference takes
place; the use of the eyes inhibits the use of the ears;
the utilization of his conscious and focused attention
militates against the proper functioning of the natural
capacities of assimilation. Moreover, he is encouraged
and trained to use the non-natural methods, he is
directed by his teacher to pay attention to everything,
to use his eyes, to memorize spellings (generally non-phonetic);
his books show him how to analyse, they
provide him with exercises calculated to make him
concentrate on the detail, and in so doing to miss the
synthetic whole. Examine the adult who is supposed
to have ‘learnt’ a foreign language; in the majority
of cases you will find that his speech is pidgin-speech,
that his sounds are wrong and wrongly distributed,
that his inflexions are inaccurate, that his sentences
are constructed on the model of his native language,
that he uses foreign words in a way unknown to the
native users of these same words. Inquire in each case
how the person acquired his knowledge, and you will find
that he acquired it by dint of exercising his capacities
for study.</p>

<p>And the minority? We find a minority (alas, a small
minority!) who have come to possess the foreign language
as if it were their first. Their sounds are right, the
distribution is right, the inflexions are accurate, their
sentences are constructed on the model of those used by
the native speakers, they use foreign words as the
natives themselves use them, they are as accurate and as
fluent in the foreign language as in their own. They do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
not interrupt the speaker of the language with requests
to speak more slowly, to speak more distinctly, to spell
or to write the words; in short, they use the second
language as they use their first. Inquire in each case
how the person acquired his knowledge, and you will find
that he acquired it by methods making no call on
his capacities for reasoning, for concentrating, for
analysing, or for theorizing. Instead of selecting and
adapting previously acquired habits connected with his
first language, he was able to form new habits.</p>

<p>To sum up our inquiry, we find that there are
people who have been able to use their spontaneous
capacities of assimilation in order to acquire a second
or a third language; we find that young children
nearly always do so, that certain adults sometimes
do so.</p>

<p>But we must make quite sure of our ground before
proceeding farther. We must ascertain definitely
whether all adults possess what we are calling this
spontaneous capacity for assimilation, or whether this is
a ‘gift’ in the usual acceptation of the term, that is,
whether it is a capacity given to some but withheld by
nature from others. Some maintain that from the age
of reason onwards none but the gifted possess the capacity
in question, and that those who do not possess it are
bound to use what we shall call the <em>studial</em> processes.
Others, on the contrary, maintain that all possess the
capacity either in an active or in a latent state, that most
adults deliberately but innocently inhibit their power, or
that, unaware that these powers exist, they fail to take
the necessary steps to awaken them from their latent
into their active state.</p>

<p>Which of these two is the correct view?</p>

<p>Let us endeavour to answer this all-important question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
by examining those who undoubtedly do possess this
‘gift’ or natural capacity. We first inquire whether
they were encouraged or disposed to resist the temptation
to receive their impressions through the eyes, to resist
the temptation to rely on spellings, whether they did
consent to use their ears as the receptive medium. In
each case we learn that they were so disposed; they
did resist the temptation towards eye-work and did
allow the ears to perform the work for which they were
intended.</p>

<p>We next inquire whether the conditions were such
as prohibited them from focusing their consciousness,
from paying an exaggerated attention to detail, from
submitting the language-matter to a form of analysis,
from comparing each foreign word or form with some
word or form of their native language. In each case we
are informed that such <em>were</em> the conditions.</p>

<p>Our next inquiry is directed towards ascertaining
whether, in the earlier stages, the conditions afforded
them full and constant opportunities of hearing the
language used, <em>without being under the necessity of speaking
it themselves</em>. In each instance we are informed that
those were precisely the conditions.</p>

<p>This is almost conclusive; we have ascertained that
each successful acquirer of the foreign language was
working precisely under the conditions enjoyed by the
young child (and we remember that the young child
is invariably a successful acquirer of foreign languages).
It is, however, not conclusive enough; we have yet
to inquire under what conditions the other type of
adult (the supposedly non-gifted one) had been working.
We ask the same three sets of questions, and in
answer we learn:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) That he was encouraged by his teachers to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
learn by the medium of his eyes, to base his knowledge
on spellings (generally non-phonetic), and in so doing to
inhibit his ears from fulfilling their natural function.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) That he generally focused his consciousness, that
he paid attention to detail, that he studied rules and
practised analysis, that he constantly established comparisons
between the foreign word and the nearest native
equivalent.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) That conditions were such that he had few or no
opportunities of hearing the language used, while he
was obliged to use the language himself, to forge out
sentences as best he might, neglectful of accuracy and
heedless of their conformity or non-conformity with
authentic models.</p>

<p>This is conclusive; there is no doubt about it now.
Those who seemingly do not possess the spontaneous
capacity for assimilating <em>foreign</em> languages are precisely
those who were unwilling to avail themselves of it,
or who were precluded from availing themselves of it.
And by developing their studial powers they simply
inhibited the spontaneous powers and effectively prevented
them from working.</p>

<p>No reasonable doubt remains: we are all endowed
by nature with certain capacities which enable each of us,
without the exercise of our powers of study, to assimilate
and to use the spoken form of any colloquial language,
whether native or foreign. We may avail ourselves of
these powers by training ourselves deliberately to utilize
them, or, having more confidence in our studial efforts,
or for some reason of special expediency, we may choose
to leave our spontaneous capacities in their latent state
and make no use of them. We cannot, however, afford
to ignore them, and it would be foolish to deny their
existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>We shall see later what steps we must take if we wish
to rouse these powers from their latent state, what we
must do if we wish to enlist them and have them at our
disposal for the purpose of learning or of teaching a
foreign language.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="smaller">OUR STUDIAL CAPACITIES AND HOW TO
USE THEM</span></h2>


<p>We have seen that each of us possesses certain
spontaneous capacities for learning how to
use the spoken form of any language or variety
of language. We have seen that these capacities may
be either in a latent or an active state. We have seen
that unless we enlist these powers in our service we are
unlikely to make any real progress in language-study,
either in point of quality or quantity. We shall see
later by what means we may awaken our latent
capacities and cause them to become active, and,
incidentally, how we can exercise ourselves to make
the fullest use of them.</p>

<p>But we also possess capacities other than these for
assimilating and using a language. It is our purpose in
the present chapter to see what these are, and to differentiate
between them and those already described.</p>

<p>In the first place, let us note carefully that we have
so far dealt with no other form of language than the
normal spoken colloquial, that form which is used under
normal conditions by the average educated native. We
have not been considering any written form of language
whatever, either colloquial or classical, nor have we
given any attention to the more classical or literary form
of speech whether spoken or written. We have, indeed,
alluded to these aspects or varieties of language, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
merely in order to state that they are beyond the range
of any truly <em>spontaneous</em> capacities. Reading and
writing are not spontaneous processes; they are even
<em>unnatural</em> processes if we do not already possess the
spoken form. Learning how to use classical or artificialized
forms of language such as poetry or rhetoric
is a more or less studial process, an <em>unnatural</em> process
if we do not already possess the normal colloquial. For
this, then, if not for other reasons, we must be prepared
to adopt certain forms of work unknown to man in
his natural state (as exemplified by the very young
child); we shall allude to these as the ‘<em>studial</em>
methods.’</p>

<p>What, then, are these studial methods? Roughly
speaking, we may say that they comprise all those
forms of work which require on the part of the student
<em>conscious efforts of attention</em>; work in which he must
think, reflect, or calculate; work necessitating the
exercise of his reasoning powers, work which cannot
be performed automatically; this constitutes conscious
work, and all methods embodying conscious work become
<i>ipso facto</i> studial methods.</p>

<p>Most work of analysis and synthesis is of this order;
all that we do to break up a sentence into words, into
syllables, into sounds; all that we do to piece together
sounds, syllables, and words in order to form sentences is
of this order. Whenever we are distinctly conscious of
the words and constructions we are using, we are doing
something unknown to nature. Whenever we come to
understand a sentence by analysing it, or to utter a
sentence by piecing together as we go on, we are working
by processes of the studial order; they were not used
when we were learning our mother-tongue.</p>

<p>All those forms of work which we may include under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the heading of ‘conversion’ are studial, and these are
many and varied. Dictation consists in causing the
pupil to convert the spoken into the written aspect of
language, reading consists in causing him to do the
reverse, most forms of translating consist in causing
him to convert something from one language into
another. We may also at times require our pupils to
convert an affirmative sentence into a negative or an
interrogative one, to convert a present tense into a
past, a singular into a plural, passive into active, to
convert a certain word-order into another.</p>

<p>All these things are of the studial order; sound they
may be, necessary or essential they may be, but they
are not spontaneous forms of work, for we have not
by their aid learnt to use the spoken colloquial form of
our mother-tongue.</p>

<p>All methods which necessitate the use of the eye are
studial methods; nature never meant us to learn spoken
language by eye. We may therefore designate as
studial all forms of reading, reading aloud or mental
reading, reading from traditional orthographies or
phonetic transcriptions, reading of isolated sounds or of
connected passages. More especially of the studial order
are those curious and complicated practices (common,
alas! to so many students) of ‘reading what we hear’ or
‘writing what we speak.’ In the former case, we hear
a sentence, we reduce it mentally to written characters,
and read mentally what we see in our imagination; in
the other case we write in our imagination what we wish
to say, and read aloud what we are writing.</p>

<p>It follows that all methods which require us to use the
hand are studial methods; nature knows no more of
spellings and handwriting than she does of shorthand,
typewriting, and type-setting; all these things are of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
comparatively recent origin, and all of them have been
deliberately invented by man.</p>

<p>All methods which teach meanings by means of
etymology are of the studial order; nature intended that
each word should become attached to that for which it
stands and not become associated with its ancestral
etymon or modern cognates. The dictum of nature is
that a word means what all speakers of the same
language (or variety of language) mean it to mean.</p>

<p>Thus it would appear that nearly everything that the
average person actually does when learning a foreign
language comes under the heading of the studial processes.
He learns rules in order to become proficient
in analysis and synthesis; for the same purpose, he
memorizes the exceptions to the rules. He becomes
(or hopes to become) an expert in pulling words to
pieces and in reconstructing them from roots and affixes,
in sentence-making and sentence-breaking. He learns
chiefly by eye, and expresses himself chiefly by the pen-grasping
hand. Indeed, he becomes so proficient in
converting the spoken into the written form that he
cannot understand or retain the foreign words or
sentences he learns until he has converted them into an
imaginary written form which, in his imagination, he
reads off word by word. Similarly, he finds himself only
able to express himself by dint of reading aloud the
sentences which he is constructing bit by bit by a complicated
process of ‘mental writing.’ He aims at
becoming (and often does become) expert in converting
one language into another by a process (unknown to
nature) called translating. His accuracy is gained by
rapid conversions of words from one inflected form to
another: nominatives into accusatives, singulars into
plurals, infinitives into participles. He attaches great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
importance to etymology, and the time he might spend in
associating words with their meanings is often devoted
to working out the family tree of foreign words. He
spends little time in finding out what meanings the
natives attach to their words and forms, but much time
in identifying the units of etymology and in tracing
them from one language to another.</p>

<p>This does not necessarily imply that the student is
always doing the wrong thing, nor that his methods are
always bad ones; we merely observe that he uses (or
is taught to use) all manner of studial methods at the
expense of spontaneous ones, and that, in so doing, he
develops his studial capacities of language-study at
the expense of his spontaneous ones. The question
whether the studial methods should be used at all and,
if so, which should be used, forms the subject of the
next chapter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="smaller">WHY WE MUST USE OUR STUDIAL
CAPACITIES</span></h2>


<p>We should not conclude that methods involving
our powers of study are to be abandoned,
and that nature alone is to be responsible for
our linguistic education. On the contrary, we suggest
that an extensive use be made of powers which are not
possessed by the young child or the barbarian.</p>

<p>In the first place, nature will not teach us to read or
to write, but merely to become proficient in the use of
the <em>spoken</em> form of a given language. However valuable
it may be to possess the spoken form, most of us wish
to go beyond this; we wish eventually to be able to
use some form of orthography. Some even desire to
go beyond this and to learn to use shorthand or the typewriter,
man-made inventions of a still more recent date.
For we must remember that, after all, traditional orthography
is not a whit more ‘natural’ than shorthand, and
a good deal less ‘natural’ than phonetic transcription
or reformed spelling.</p>

<p>To learn, however, the written form of a language
before having learnt how to assimilate the spoken form
is unnatural and contrary to all our linguistic instincts;
it is comparable to learning to cycle before having learnt
to walk. At a certain stage, therefore, the learner will
be taught how to recognize by eye what he has already
assimilated by ear, and how to express with the pen what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
he has hitherto expressed by means of articulate sounds.
In each case the process will be one of conversion, converting
written characters into sounds or converting
sounds into written characters. In both cases there will
be articulation of some sort, for mental reading means
mental articulation, and when we write we only write
what we are repeating to ourselves mentally.</p>

<p>Neither of these forms of conversion is necessarily
difficult. The processes, without being spontaneous in
the true sense of the term, present at times certain
analogies to truly spontaneous processes in that they are
apparently performed without effort. Much depends,
however, on the system of script; if the alphabet of
the foreign language is almost identical with an alphabet
we have already learnt to use, the difficulty will be
less than in the case of a totally strange alphabet or
syllabary. Japanese script, which contains a strange
mixture of Chinese characters used both ideographically
and phonetically, together with two different systems
of native phonetic writing, presents difficulties unknown
to the European student of European languages.</p>

<p>The artificial element in writing is particularly evident
when we consider that many if not most orthographic
systems are in contradiction to the spoken form of the
languages they claim to represent. English spelling is
an excellent case in point; its divergences from the
actual language are so numerous and so great that we
may be said to possess two distinct languages, the
spoken and the written. To learn and to apply the
arbitrary laws and conventions which serve to bridge the
gap between the two requires capacities of observation
and reasoning of a special order, essentially studial. For
that reason we must make use of conversion devices of
various kinds: dictation, reading aloud, transcription<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
(or transliteration), and spelling drill. Many so-called
‘difficulties of grammar’ prove to be mere difficulties
of spelling; the French conjugation and what remains
of French declension are largely matters of spelling, often
as baffling to the native French speaker as to the non-French
student.</p>

<p>There are other reasons why studial methods must be
adopted in a complete language-course. There exist
forms of speech other than the form which is used normally
in everyday conversation. There exist artificialized
non-colloquial dialects, such as poetry, the language
of emotion and oratory, the language of ceremony,
the liturgical, and similar classical or archaic varieties.
As we have already seen, nature teaches us only those
living forms which are used by the people of our environment;
for the others we must have recourse to studial
methods. The everyday colloquial form is something
we learn at home or in the street; the higher or more
æsthetic forms are taught us at school or at college; we
have to <em>study</em> them. The art of literary composition,
the art of selecting and assembling deliberately and consciously
those words which express our thoughts and
emotions in the clearest and most appropriate manner,
differs widely and essentially from the art of colloquy as
exercised in our daily life. In order to become proficient
in literary composition, we must acquire habits of concentration,
we must be able to analyse, we must become
expert in synthesis, we must learn to discriminate, we
must develop our intelligence. The young child cannot
do these things, nor can the savage or the idiot.</p>

<p>There is another reason why we cannot leave everything
to nature: most language-courses must necessarily
be <em>corrective courses</em>. The teacher generally finds among
his adult students a large number who have already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
acquired certain notions of the language; they may have
spent one or more years working at school-French,
school-English, or whatever the language may be; they
may have spent some time in the country where it is
spoken, or they may have studied privately. In most
of these cases it is practically certain that the student
will have formed bad linguistic habits; his pronunciation
will be deplorable, his command of the inflected
forms will be deficient, his syntax will be faulty, and his
semantic system will be that of his native tongue. In
other terms, he has acquired a pidgin form of the language,
such as Anglo-French or Franco-English, unnatural
dialects unknown to native speakers; he may
have become accustomed to using this form of language,
even to using it automatically. Nor is that all; not
only is his language-material faulty (to say the least of
it), but his manner of study will probably have impaired
very seriously his capacities for any sound form of
assimilation. He has not been trained to observe nor
to imitate nor to construct sentences by analogy; he
has so trained himself to hearing what he expects to
hear and what he thinks he hears that he has no notion
of what he actually does hear; in short, he has generally
learnt wrong material in wrong ways.</p>

<p>The only suitable course for such a student would be
a corrective course, a course which would aim at replacing
his faulty material by sound material and at replacing
his former methods of study by sound methods. One
by one his unsound acquisitions must be replaced by
sound ones; we must teach him a new language. Now
this cannot be done by means of spontaneous methods
alone; unconsciousness will not undo the work consciousness
has done; the natural powers which enable us to
assimilate normal speech will rarely, if ever, turn bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
habits into good ones or convert pidgin-speech into
normal speech. What has been done consciously must
be undone consciously. The student must be shown
specifically in what respects his speech differs from that
used by natives, and he must deliberately set to work
to correct it item by item; we must explain things to
him; we must provide him with charts, diagrams, and
exercises; we must put him through courses of drill-work,
and all these things will require his careful and
even concentrated attention. We must also teach him
how to correct his faulty methods of assimilating; we
must explain to him why they are faulty and convince
him that, however natural and easy they may seem to
him, they are only of utility to the learner of pidgin-speech.
We must teach him how to utilize the sound
processes (both spontaneous and studial); he will not
like to do so, he will constantly tend to revert to the
processes to which he has become accustomed; we must
react and cause him to react against his vicious tendencies.
After a time, if fortunate, we may succeed in
eradicating most of the faulty matter and in initiating
the right habits of assimilation. From that point
onwards the course will not be a corrective one but a
normal one.</p>

<p>Do these considerations apply only to one who has
already studied the language faultily, to the user of
pidgin-speech? Are we to take it that the raw beginner
is exempt from unnatural or vicious habits? Unfortunately
this is not the case: more often than not, the
student (even the student unspoiled by previous defective
work) will tend to let his first language influence
his second. If he is English, he will tend to insinuate
English sounds, English forms, and English thoughts
into the new language, which will therefore tend to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
become pidginized. This tendency will be greater with
some than with others; much depends on the attitude
of the student towards the language he is about to
learn; he may already have studied other foreign
languages, and in doing so may have acquired the
wrong attitude towards foreign languages in general.
If he considers them as branches of study similar to
mathematics, history, or geography; or if he considers
them essentially as orthographic systems of which the
phonetic form is an unimportant detail, he will already
have become one for whom a corrective course is
necessary. We shall have to remove his prejudices
and to modify his point of view; a certain amount
of preliminary work will have to be done in order
that he may see languages as they really are, in order
that he may see the nature of the task before him.
This preliminary work will be of the studial order, but
will be succeeded at the right moment by the more
normal and more spontaneous methods. On the other
hand, many students start with no preconceived ideas
whatever; children, the less intelligent adults, and those
who have been unspoiled by the traditional classical
fallacies will slip easily and naturally into the right
attitude. They will recognize the necessity for learning
new sounds and combinations, for assimilating foreign
material without at each instant comparing it with the
material of the mother-tongue; for retaining by the
auditory memory strings of words and sentences, for
reproducing orally what they hear, and for forming the
right semantic associations. Such students will be immune
or nearly so from the vicious tendencies which so
characterize the average language-learner; they will
merely have to be put on their guard at certain critical
moments; we shall at such moments observe certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
reasonable precautions in order that bad habits may not
be acquired.</p>

<p>A fourth reason why we must not neglect the studial
methods may be mentioned here. Many set out not so
much to acquire the capacity for using the language
as to learn its structure and peculiarities, just as a
mechanic may wish to become acquainted with a
machine without having the intention of ever using
it. Phoneticians, grammarians, and philologists must
in the ordinary course of their work become familiar
with the characteristic features of many languages or
dialects. For this purpose it is by no means necessary
that they should acquire the capacity for understanding,
speaking, reading, or writing the languages which interest
them.</p>

<p>In such cases the spontaneous methods would obviously
be out of place; no call need be made or should be made
on the students’ natural powers of language-assimilating.
They would proceed by way of analysis and
synthesis, and instead of retaining the actual language-material
itself would retain merely the laws which
govern the functioning of the language.</p>

<p>We might place in this category of students those
whose subsequent intention is to teach the language to
others. It may not be necessary for the language-<em>learner</em>
to know much about the theory of phonetics, but
the language-<em>teacher</em> must possess a considerable knowledge
of phonetic theory both general and as applied to
the particular language in which he is an instructor. The
learner need know little about the sciences dealing with
inflexions, sentence-construction, or meanings; but the
teacher must know a good deal about these things in
order that he may foresee the special difficulties which
his pupils will encounter, and devise the necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
exercises to overcome them. The technical side of
language will therefore be of importance to all who are
or who intend to become teachers, and such knowledge,
like any other technical knowledge, is acquired by
methods unrelated to our spontaneous capacities for
assimilating normal colloquial speech.</p>

<p>The four series of considerations set forth above are
sufficient to show that it would be either unwise or impossible
to proceed by the sole aid of nature or by the
reconstitution of natural conditions. Language-study
is such a complex thing, with so many aspects, and it
requires to be looked at from so many points of view,
that we must enlist <em>all</em> our capacities when striving to
obtain the mastery we desire; we must not neglect our
spontaneous powers, nor should we despise our intellectual
powers; both are of service to us, both have
their place in a well-conceived programme of study,
each will to a certain extent balance the other and be
complementary to it. An excess on either side may
be prejudicial to the student, and one of the more
important problems before the speech-psychologist is to
determine in what circumstances and on what occasions
each should be used. More will be said on this
particular phase of the subject in Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_XV">XV</a> (“The
Multiple Line of Approach”).</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="smaller">THE STUDENT AND HIS AIM</span></h2>


<p>What is the best method of language-study?
This fundamental question is one which is
continually asked by all those who are
seriously engaged in teaching or in learning a foreign
language. We say ‘seriously’ and lay stress on the
word, for among teachers and students there are many,
unfortunately, who are not disposed to take their work
seriously, who see no necessity for any earnest consideration
of the ways and means to be adopted. They are
content to teach as they themselves have been taught,
or to learn as others have learnt before them, without
inquiring whether the plan or the programme is a sound
one, without even inquiring whether the method is one
which is likely to produce any good results whatever.
But the serious teacher or student, who wishes to perform
efficient work, must of necessity ask himself
whether the path he has chosen is one which will lead
anywhere near the desired end or ends. He may
experiment with various methods and try a number of
different systems in order to ascertain which of these
secures the best results, and after many such trials
he may either hit upon what seems to be an ideal type
of work and stick to it, or, dissatisfied with everything
he has tried, he may once again seek counsel and ask
once more the old and hackneyed question: What is
the best method of language-study?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The first answer which suggests itself is: “The
best method is that which adopts the best means to
the required end,” and indeed this is perhaps the
only concise answer which can be furnished off-hand.
But the answer is not satisfactory; it is too general,
and so true that it ranks as a truism; it is resented
as being a facetious manner of shelving the question.
The inquirer has every right to return to the charge
and to put the supplementary question: “What is
the method which adopts the best means to the
required end?”</p>

<p>In the present book we shall endeavour to find the
best answer or the best series of answers to this most
legitimate question. In doing so we shall set forth, with
as much precision as is consistent with the claims of
conciseness, the conclusions arrived at by those who
have specialized in the subject and have obtained positive
evidence bearing on it.</p>

<p>Fundamental as the question appears, there is yet
a previous question of which we must dispose before
going further, for we cannot determine “what is
the best method adopting the best means towards the
required end” until we know more precisely what <em>is</em> the
required end.</p>

<p>For there are many possible ends, and many categories
of students, each with a particular aim before
him.</p>

<p>Many desire a knowledge of the written language only;
they wish to be able to read and write, not to understand
the spoken language nor to speak. Some may limit
their attainment to a capacity for reading the language;
they wish to have direct access to technical or other
books. Others conceivably may wish solely to become
able to write letters in the language. Many are only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
concerned with spoken language; they wish to be able
to speak and to understand what they hear. Some
wish to possess an ‘understanding’ knowledge only,
while others are content merely to make themselves
understood.</p>

<p>The student may limit his requirements to a very
superficial knowledge of some pidgin form of the language,
and will be perfectly happy if he just succeeds in making
himself understood by using some atrocious caricature
of the language which he is supposed to be learning. Or
he may be more ambitious and set out in earnest to
become master of the living language just as it is spoken
and written by the natives themselves. The phonetician
will wish to attain absolute perfection in the pronunciation
of the language; the etymologist will concentrate
on the historical aspect; the philologist will not be happy
unless he is comparing the structure with that of cognate
languages; the grammarian will specialize in grammar,
and the lexicologist or semantician will study the
meanings.</p>

<p>The clerk or merchant will specialize in the commercial
language and learn how to draw up bills of lading or to
conduct business correspondence. The hotel-keeper or
waiter will concentrate on hotel colloquial, as also will
the tourist or tripper. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">littérateur</i> will aim straight
at the literature and disdain any of the non-æsthetic
aspects or branches. Every calling or profession will
seek its own particular line, and for each there will be a
particular aim.</p>

<p>Many students have as their sole aim the passing of a
given examination. Whether they come to know the
language or not is a matter of comparative indifference
to them; their business is to obtain as many marks as
possible with the least amount of effort, and what does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
not lead directly to this aim is not of interest. It is the
duty of many or most teachers to coach or to cram their
pupils in order that satisfactory examination results
may be obtained; they cannot afford to do anything
else, nor have they any desire to do so. If the examination
includes questions on phonetic theory, the pupil
will be crammed with phonetic theory; if it includes
a test in conversation, the pupil will be crammed
with conversational tags; if it requires the capacity
of translating, the pupil will duly be coached in the
art of translating; if it requires a knowledge of a
given text or series of texts, these will be the subject
of study. If the pupil or his teacher knows something
of the particular examiner, special efforts will be
made to please that particular examiner. But this
has little or nothing to do with the serious study of
languages.</p>

<p>Some people are professional translators or interpreters;
it is their business to render a faithful account
of a speech or a sentence uttered in another language or
to interpret the thoughts of some foreign writer. This
work requires very special qualifications and necessitates
a very special study, so much so that those who are
perfectly bilingual experience a great difficulty every
time that they are called upon to render a faithful
translation of any document or a faithful interpretation
of any oral communication. The task of the translator
is quite distinct from that of the ordinary student of
language, and is to be dealt with as such. Generally
speaking, however, the language-learner will have
comparatively little to do with the profession of
interpreter or translator, and even in the exceptional
cases he will do well to leave this particular branch
until he has attained a certain proficiency in using<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the foreign language independently of any other.
We have already alluded to the special requirements
of the technician; we have seen that some require a
knowledge of the structure or of certain aspects of one
or more languages.</p>

<p>Such people, having entirely different aims, require
entirely different methods; they must be furnished
with everything that will facilitate their work of
analysis or synthesis, and we may omit from their
programme everything which does not lead directly
towards the limited and special end they have in
view.</p>

<p>Yet another factor is present and must be considered
before we can draw up any definite programme of study.
Are we giving a three months’ course or a three years’
course? If we are to obtain concrete and definite
results in a limited space of time, our course must
necessarily be an intensive one; we shall have to make a
generous use of studial methods; we shall not be able
to afford anything like an adequate period of preparation;
we shall be forced to take short cuts and we shall
reluctantly be compelled to sacrifice a certain measure
of soundness to the requirements of speed. If, however,
at the end of the short course to which circumstances
limit our student’s opportunity, he has a chance to continue
his studies by himself or to reside in the country
where the language is spoken, we may devote the whole
of our time to preparatory work. We may give him
an intensive course of ear-training, articulation, or
fluency exercises, cause him to memorize a certain
number of key-sentences, and drill him into good habits
of language-study. If we adopted this plan we should
be laying the foundations upon which the student would
build later by his own initiative, but the drawback<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
would be that the student would have made but
small progress in the actual process of assimilating
vocabulary; he would be well prepared, but would
have little to show as a result of his two or three
months’ work.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, we know that we have a clear
period of two or more years before us, our task will be
much easier. Instead of proceeding at a breathless rate
to produce immediate concrete results, we may go to
work in a more leisurely and more natural way. We
may sow, and be assured that the harvest will be reaped
in due time; the natural powers of language-study work
surely but not rapidly; nature takes her time but yields
a generous interest. With a long period in front of us,
we may afford adequate intervals for ‘incubation’; it
will not be necessary for us to accelerate the normal
process of assimilation, but merely to let it develop in
a gradual but ever-increasing and cumulative ratio.
At the end of, let us say, the first year, our student
will easily outstrip those whose initial progress seemed
more satisfactory.</p>

<p>Evidently it will not be possible to draw up a programme
of study which will be suitable for all the
diverse requirements we have set forth. Nor will it be
possible for every teacher to consider the individual
requirements of each one of his pupils. We cannot have
a specially printed course, nor even a manuscript one,
for every student; but in the case of private lessons
or of self-instruction we may certainly give a large
amount of consideration to individual needs. The bad
pronouncer will concentrate on phonetic work, the
bad speller on orthographic work, the bad listener
on devices leading towards immediate comprehension;
the clerk will work with texts of a commercial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
nature, the tourist will specialize on hotel colloquial,
etc. No student will ever be expected to work
with one book only; each will gradually acquire a
miniature library, and this library need not be the
same for everybody.</p>

<p>In the case of collective courses and class teaching,
individual requirements will be less observed, but in
drawing up the programme the teacher will aim at the
average result desired by or considered desirable for the
average member of the class. As we shall see later, it is
quite feasible to design lessons suitable for a class containing
pupils of different capacities; we can arrange
that some shall take an active part while others are
assimilating more or less passively.</p>

<p>We see, in short, that when starting a new course
under new conditions the teacher must draw up a
programme. This programme will be divided into
so many periods or stages, and for each period certain
forms of work will be specified, these being designed
to lead in the most efficient way to whatever the
aim may happen to be. Without such a programme
the teacher will never know exactly where his class
stands, the work will be too much of a hand-to-mouth
nature, and there will be loose ends. This programme
may of course be more or less experimental or tentative;
it may be modified in accordance with the
teacher’s experience and with the results he has so far
obtained. The idea of a hard-and-fast programme
does not commend itself; it should, on the contrary,
be more or less elastic in order that it may be expanded
or contracted according to circumstances. Anything in
the nature of a ‘patent method’ (guaranteed to work
within so many lessons) suggests quackery. Our
programme should be something other than a rigid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
procedure based on any one particular principle, however
logical that principle may seem to be. There are many
logical principles, and we must strive to incorporate all
of them into whatever programme we design. We shall
treat of these in the next chapters.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="smaller">THE SUPREME IMPORTANCE OF THE
ELEMENTARY STAGE</span></h2>


<p>Before examining and reviewing the principles
of language-study, it will be well for us to note
one important point. The reader ere long may
protest that we pay no attention to anything except
beginner’s work, that we examine no evidence bearing on
the more advanced stages, that we give no advice nor
offer any suggestions concerning the work of the second
and subsequent years. “We are not interested in
elementary work,” some may say; “what we require is a
series of counsels as to how to conduct the subsequent
(and more difficult) work.”</p>

<p>And yet we shall have little to say concerning the more
advanced course; on the contrary, we shall constantly
lay stress and insist on the supreme importance of the
elementary stage.</p>

<p>It is the first lessons that count; it is the early lessons
which are going to determine the eventual success or
failure of the course. As the bending of the twig
determines the form of the tree, as on the foundations
depends the stability of the building, so also will the
elementary training of the student determine his subsequent
success or failure.</p>

<p>It is during the first stage that we can secure habits of
accuracy, that we can train the student to use his ears,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
that we can develop his capacities of natural and rapid
assimilation, that we can foster his powers of observation.
Good habits are easily formed (as also are bad
habits); at the outset of his studies the learner, whoever
he may be, educated or illiterate, child or adult, enjoys
the advantage of a plastic mind; it can be shaped
according to our will; we can train it to form good and
sound habits of language-study. At no other period
shall we find such plasticity. Difficult, almost impossible,
is the task of undoing what has already been done, of
removing faulty habits of perception and of replacing
them by sound ones. The student who has passed
through an unsound elementary course finds his road
to progress barred; the twig has been badly bent, the
foundations have been badly laid. All we can then do is
to endeavour by means of a corrective course to undo the
mischief which has been done, and a thankless task it is.
No amount of advanced work can fully compensate or
make good the harm which has been wrought by the
untrained or unwise teacher. It is too late. Certain
habits have been formed, and we all realize what it
means to eradicate a bad habit and to replace it by a
good one.</p>

<p>What are some of these bad habits? What are the
most characteristic vicious tendencies which have been
encouraged by an unsound elementary stage? Some of
these are positive, others are negative. In some cases
the student has acquired bad habits; in others he
has neglected to acquire good ones; often the two
kinds are complementary to each other. We find, for
instance, that he has neglected to train his ears, he has
not been shown what to observe nor how to observe.
The consequence is that he is unaware of the existence of
certain foreign sounds, and invariably replaces them by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
absurd or impossible imitations based on the sounds of
his mother-tongue. Instead of French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">é</i> he will use
English <i>ay</i>; instead of French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">on</i> he will use English
<i>ong</i>; a trilled <i>r</i> will be replaced by an English fricative <i>r</i>
or by no <i>r</i> at all.</p>

<p>Lack of ear-training will cause him to insert imaginary
sounds where there are none. The French student will
introduce an <i>r</i> (and a French <i>r</i> at that!) in words such
as <i>course</i> or <i>farm</i>; he will insert a weak <i>e</i> [ə] in the <i>pl</i> of
<i>people</i> or in the <i>bl</i> of <i>able</i>. He has never actually heard
such sounds, but imagines that he has; his ears have not
been trained to observe. He has formed the habit of
replacing ear-impressions by eye-impressions; he believes
what his eyes tell him, and his untrained ears cannot
correct the tendency; he has become the dupe of
unphonetic spellings.</p>

<p>The neglect of his powers of audition will cause him to
rely absolutely on his powers of visualizing the written
form. He will refuse to receive the language-matter by
the auditory channel; he will declare with insistence
that “he cannot learn a word or a sentence until he has
seen it written”; he will even decline to learn a word
except in its traditional (and probably phonetically
inaccurate) orthographic form.</p>

<p>If the elementary course has not provided for the
development and use of the powers of unconscious
assimilation, the student will attempt the hopeless
task of passing the whole of the language-material
through his limited channel of consciousness. He
will seek to concentrate his attention on every simple
unit of which the foreign language is composed, and
hope thereby to retain every one, a feat of memory
which we know to be impossible. He will therefore
have formed the habit of deliberately avoiding that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
natural process which alone will enable him to make
effective progress.</p>

<p>He will also have formed the ‘isolating’ habit, which
consists in learning the individual elements of a group
instead of learning the group as it stands. He will
learn <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chaise</i> instead of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la chaise</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">allé</i> instead of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">suis allé</i> or
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">est allé</i>. In other terms, he will have formed the habit of
word-learning and have neglected that of word-group-learning.
Hence, instead of having at his disposal a
number of useful compounds such as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je ne le lui ai pas
donné</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il n’y en a pas de ce côté-ci</i>, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">À cette époque-ci</i>, he
will endeavour laboriously and generally unsuccessfully
to build up by some synthetic process (probably that of
literal translation) every word-group, phrase, or sentence
in the language.</p>

<p>Had his elementary course included the systematic
memorizing of word-groups, this would have become
a habit; as it is, he has acquired the habit of not
doing so.</p>

<p>Bad semantic habits may also have been formed.
That is to say, the student may have trained himself
(or even may have been trained) to consider that each
foreign word corresponds precisely to some word in his
own language. For him <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prendre</i> is the exact equivalent
of <i>to take</i>; <i>to get</i> is an untranslatable word, and many
foreign words are meaningless!</p>

<p>If translation (not in itself a bad habit) has been
carried to extremes, and if the habit of direct
association has been neglected, the student will have
formed the habit of translating mentally everything
that he hears or reads, and this will be fatal to
subsequent progress.</p>

<p>The principle of gradation may have been faultily
applied in different ways. The teacher may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
considered it his duty to over-articulate his words, to
pause before each word, and to speak under the normal
speed of five syllables per second. In this case the
student will have formed the habit of understanding no
form of speech other than this artificialized type. The
capacity for understanding normal, rapid, and even
under-articulated speech can only be developed by
exercise in listening to such speech, and he will not have
had this exercise.</p>

<p>The elementary programme may also have been drawn
up in such a way as to preclude the study of irregular
forms. If this has been the case, the student, unprepared
for irregularities, will not know how to deal
with them, and his rate of progress will be correspondingly
diminished when they occur in more advanced
work.</p>

<p>These are some of the bad habits, positive and negative,
which will result from an unsound elementary course;
these will be some of the fruits of early lessons which have
not been based on the essential principles of language-teaching.</p>

<p>One of the functions of an elementary course is to
enable the student to make use, even if only in a rudimentary
way, of the language he is learning. It is
therefore maintained by some that any form whatever
of teaching which leads to such result may be
considered as satisfactory. On these grounds it
might be urged that, as pidgin-speech is better than
no speech at all, we should at the outset aim at
pidgin, and leave it to the more advanced stage to
convert this type of speech into the normal variety as
used by the natives.</p>

<p>But those who may hold this view forget that
the elementary course has a second and more im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>portant
function, viz. so to prepare the student
that his subsequent rate of progress shall constantly
increase.</p>

<p>The quantity of matter contained in even the everyday
language is great&mdash;greater than most of us generally
imagine. Not only are there thousands of words, but
the majority of these consist of a group of allied
forms, declensional, conjugational, and derivative.
Very many words also stand for two, three, or
more different meanings; moreover, the meaning of
any word is influenced by the presence of other
words in the same sentence. Were the beginner
able to see in advance the full extent of the work
that lies before him, he might abandon his task at
the outset.</p>

<p>The work of assimilating this enormous mass of
language-stuff will certainly never be accomplished
on retail lines; it will not be done by mere efforts
of analysis, synthesis, and eye-work. Unless the rate of
progress increases continuously, unless the principle of
gradation is observed strictly, there is no prospect of the
student gaining that mastery of the language which is
his aim.</p>

<p>It is the elementary stage, long or short, which will
prepare the student for this increasing rate of progress,
and an elementary course which has not so prepared the
student cannot be said to have accomplished its purpose.
It is during the elementary stage that we turn out the
good or the bad worker. The function of the first lessons
is not only to teach the language, but, more important
still, <em>to teach the student how to learn</em>.</p>

<p>When we have instilled into him the habits of
correct observation, of using his ears, of using his
capacities for unconscious assimilation, of forming direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
associations&mdash;in short, when we have taught him how
to learn&mdash;the subsequent stages may safely be left to
the student and to nature. Let us take care of the
elementary stage, and the advanced stage will take
care of itself.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="smaller">THE PRINCIPLES OF LANGUAGE-TEACHING</span></h2>


<p>The art of method-writing (or of course-designing,
which is not very different) is in its infancy; it
has all the marks of the early or even primitive
stage; it is in a state of slow evolution comparable to
that which characterized the gradual perfecting of mechanical
inventions and devices such as the typewriter,
the bicycle, or the calculating machine. In the early
stages of each of these (and many similar things) each
model was more or less rudimentary and clumsy. A
dozen different inventors working individually produced
a dozen different machines; although all designed to
accomplish the same work, the means adopted in each
case differed fundamentally. In 1890 it was possible to
distinguish even at a distance the make of any particular
bicycle. At the present day we can still see great
differences of structure between the different makes of
typewriters and calculating machines. As time goes on,
however, we notice a gradual convergence of types;
one inventor profits by the work of others; in spite of
the laws of patent, certain improvements are copied or
adapted, individual defects are gradually eliminated and
devices or dispositions which have proved their worth
are adopted. The tendency is always towards the more
perfect type, the more efficient apparatus; and the
path towards perfection is marked by an ever-growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
convergence of types. The ideal appears to be reached
when there is practically no scope for further improvements;
by that time the theoretical principles have
been worked out and have become common property;
what divergences do continue to exist are not concerned
with essentials, they are merely variations of equal
value. Were we to ask a hundred different bicycle-makers
or boat-builders to design what they considered
an ideal model, the hundred resultant models would be
for all practical purposes identical.</p>

<p>Now, if we asked a hundred different language-teachers
to design what each considered an ideal course or text-book,
the result at the present day would certainly be
a hundred different courses. They would differ in every
conceivable way; most of them would differ from the
others fundamentally. This would prove that the art in
question is in a very early stage; it would prove that
few or no fundamental principles are generally recognized.
If, however, at some date in the distant future
we were to make the same request, restricting our
invitation to those who will have made a special study
of the subject, to those who will have been striving
towards perfection, we should probably find no great
degree of diversity in the treatment; we should see the
converging tendency at work, and should gather that
the fundamental principles were beginning to stand out
and to be respected. In the yet more distant future the
answer to our request might take the form of a hundred
manuscripts, all essentially the same, and differing only
in non-essential details; we should then know that the
fundamental principles had been established and had
been accepted, but by that time none but experts in the
subject will ever venture to carry out such highly
technical work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Much time will probably elapse before we arrive at
this desirable state of things; much error will have to
be eliminated and much experimental work will have to be
accomplished. We shall have to ascertain exactly what
does take place when we learn, and exactly what are
the mental processes involved. We shall then have to
grope about and feel our way, adopting and rejecting,
modifying and adapting, improving and perfecting. We
shall have to co-ordinate our efforts so that each may
profit by the success or failure of fellow-workers; we
shall have to experiment under all sorts of conditions,
with all sorts of learners, and with all sorts of languages.
There are distinct signs to-day that this kind of co-operation
is coming about. We see, for instance, that
the branch of language-study concerned with pronunciation
is already far advanced in the experimental stage.
For years past phoneticians have been busily engaged
in research work; at first working apart, they are now
coming together and pooling their efforts, each profiting
by the discoveries of the others. A universal terminology
is coming into existence; a universal phonetic
alphabet is well on its way; the principles of phonetics
and of phonetic transcription are developing rapidly, and
the inevitable experts’ quarrels are becoming more and
more confined to matters of detail and to non-essentials.
The remarkable advance in this comparatively new
science is one of the most hopeful signs of progress, and
a pledge of eventual perfection.</p>

<p>A similar advance in the sister sciences such as grammar
and semantics is not yet apparent, but there are
signs that ere long the many isolated workers in these
domains will be able to do what the phoneticians did
twenty or thirty years ago; they will enlist new workers,
they will open up the field of research, they will draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
up, first tentatively and then decisively, the broad
principles on which the experimental and constructive
work will repose, there will be co-ordinated and co-operative
effort in many countries, and we shall witness
the coming into existence of the general science of
linguistics.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the subject is engaging the attention
of psychologists. Strangely enough, the psychologists,
whose function it is to ascertain how we learn, have not
been consulted by writers of language-courses, and few
of them have ever intervened in the matter. Each
language-teacher has had to feel his way as best he
could, proceeding empirically, dabbling in psychology,
which meant that he did not always apply and often
misinterpreted whatever principles of the subject he
may have picked up. There are signs that speech-psychologists
are about to co-ordinate their efforts with
those of the phoneticians and with the experience of
those who are actively engaged in making their language-teaching
more efficient. We can point to more than one
centre both in England and abroad where this co-operation
is in its initial stage, and once this co-operation
becomes an accomplished fact progress will be very rapid,
and the progress will be sound. The work of Sweet, of
Jespersen, and of de Saussure (to cite only three of
our modern leaders) has already paved the way for the
new and growing contingent of workers who are prepared
to take up the threads and to weave them together
in the fabric of the future.</p>

<p>What are the principles of language-study so far
evolved? What are the fundamental axioms so far
postulated? Do they give us the impression of soundness?
Do they appear to us to be reasonable? Do
they bear the aspect of finality? We shall judge. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
shall endeavour to formulate the leading principles which
have resulted from long periods of experimental work
so far carried on by individual workers. The list will
probably not be exhaustive, nor will the items be presented
in that perfectly logical sequence which the future
reserves for it. It will, however, seek to embody the
largest number of important precepts under the smallest
number of headings, in order that we may see in a concise
form something which is still evolving and progressing
towards further efficiency and simplicity. We purposely
omit from the list certain minor principles and modes
of application, nor can particular details connected with
the study of particular languages be well included in
the present work.</p>

<p>At the present day nine essential principles seem to
stand out fairly clearly, and may provisionally be named
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
(1) Initial preparation.<br />
(2) Habit-forming.<br />
(3) Accuracy.<br />
(4) Gradation.<br />
(5) Proportion.<br />
(6) Concreteness.<br />
(7) Interest.<br />
(8) Order of progression.<br />
(9) Multiple line of approach.
</p>
</div>

<p>We append a brief definition or broad description of
these principles, and reserve for the following chapters
a detailed explanation of each of them.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Initial Preparation.</i>&mdash;During the initial stages of
the course the teacher will, if necessary, endeavour by
means of appropriate forms of exercise to awaken
and to develop the student’s natural or spontaneous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
capacities for language-study, in order that he may be
adequately prepared for his subsequent work.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Habit-forming.</i>&mdash;Language-study is essentially a
habit-forming process; the teacher will therefore not
only assist the student in utilizing his previously formed
habits, but will also cause him to acquire new ones appropriate
to the work he is to perform.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Accuracy.</i>&mdash;No form of work is to be adopted
which may lead to inaccurate habits of language-using,
for habit-forming without accuracy means the forming
of bad habits.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Gradation.</i>&mdash;The teacher will cause the student to
pass from the known to the unknown by easy stages,
each of which will serve as a preparation for the next,
and thereby secure a constantly increasing rate of
progress.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Proportion.</i>&mdash;The various aspects of language (<i>i.e.</i>
understanding, speaking, reading, and writing) as well
as the various branches of the study (<i>i.e.</i> phonetics, orthography,
etymology, syntax, and semantics) to receive an
appropriate measure of attention.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Concreteness.</i>&mdash;The student will proceed from the
concrete to the abstract, and will therefore be furnished
with an abundance of well-chosen examples.</p>

<p>(7) <i>Interest.</i>&mdash;The methods are to be devised in such
a way that the interest of the student is always secured,
for without interest there can be little progress.</p>

<p>(8) <i>Order of Progression.</i>&mdash;The student should first be
taught to hear and to articulate correctly, then to use
sentences, then to make sentences, then to make (<i>i.e.</i> to
inflect or to derive) words. In this way he will secure
rapid and yet permanent results.</p>

<p>(9) <i>Multiple Line of Approach.</i>&mdash;The language should
be approached simultaneously from many different sides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
in many different ways, by means of many different
forms of work.</p>

<p>Text-books may differ in the sort of material supplied;
teachers may differ in their mode of presentation; there
will be room for individuality and personality. For
years to come we shall not secure perfect uniformity and
ideal results, but if these nine essential principles are
understood and reasonably well observed by the method-writer,
course-designer, and teacher, the resultant teaching
is bound to be good and the results are bound to be
satisfactory.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="smaller">INITIAL PREPARATION</span></h2>


<p>In the first chapter we have seen that each of us,
child or adult, possesses in either an active or a
latent state certain capacities for the spontaneous
assimilation of the spoken and colloquial form of any
given language, native or foreign. In the case of the
young child, these capacities are in an active state and
at his immediate service, he does not require to be
trained in their use; in the case of the average adult,
these capacities are in a latent state, they have fallen
into disuse, they are not at his immediate service, he
must train himself to use them, he must learn how to
learn.</p>

<p>In the first place, he must realize that language-learning
(within the scope of our definition) is an <em>art</em> and
not a <em>science</em>; to become proficient in an <em>art</em> is to acquire
the capacity for <em>doing</em> something; to become proficient
in a <em>science</em> is to acquire <em>knowledge</em> concerning something.
So long as the student treats language-study as a science
he will make little or no progress in the art of using
language.</p>

<p>Now, there are two possible ways of acquiring proficiency
in an art; the one consists in applying theory,
the other consists in persistent efforts to imitate the
successful performances of others. Let us say that the
student wishes to use the French equivalent of ‘she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
went.’ By the method of theory he will remember that
past actions are generally expressed by the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passé
indéfini</i> (or <i>perfect</i>); he will then remember that this
tense is formed by means of one of the two auxiliaries
plus the past participle. His knowledge of theory will
tell him to derive from the infinitive <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aller</i> the past
participle <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">allé</i>; theory will also tell him that this particular
verb requires the auxiliary <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">être</i> and not <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">avoir</i>, and
that the present tense third person singular of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">être</i> is
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">est</i>. If he is writing the sentence, he must remember
that the participle must in this case agree with the
subject and be spelt <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">allée</i>.</p>

<p>By the method of practice he will merely reproduce by
imitation the sentence <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">elle est allée</i>, which sentence he
will have had occasions of learning or of reading. In
both cases there is the possibility of error; the theory
may be imperfectly known and one or more links in the
chain of reasoning may be weak, or the sentence may
have been badly memorized.</p>

<p>First attempts at imitation are sometimes inaccurate;
our initial attempts at reproducing are occasionally unsuccessful;
we wish to produce a foreign sound we have
just heard, but utter a native sound instead; we wish
to produce a foreign sentence, but construct it wrongly;
we wish to express a certain thought, and fail to hit upon
the right word. For this reason the method of practice
is often termed <em>the method of trial and error</em>. We are
told that some of our efforts will be successful and others
unsuccessful, and that in the course of practice we shall
gradually eliminate the unsuccessful ones. We are even
told that it is only by making mistakes that we learn
not to make them. Although we may admit a modicum
of truth in this somewhat hyperbolical dictum, we would
suggest that it is liable to misinterpretation. Nor is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the term <em>trial and error</em> an ideal one from the language-teacher’s
point of view.</p>

<p>In both cases there is an implication that all successful
attempts must necessarily be preceded by unsuccessful
ones, which is not only untrue but unsound pedagogy.
The literal interpretation of the term and doctrine may
induce a sort of fatalistic attitude, and the principle of
<em>accuracy</em> (which we shall deal with later) will suffer in
consequence. It may provide teacher and student with
an easy pretext to condone careless work. The student
may say, “Since it appears that error must precede
perfection, I will not unduly strive towards accuracy.”
The teacher may say, “Since psychologists tell us that
error is inevitable, I will allow my pupil to do inaccurate
work.”</p>

<p>It may be true that some forms of inaccuracy in certain
conditions tend to eliminate themselves in the course of
time and practice, but it is certainly true that errors
also tend to become habitual, and no psychologist has
ever maintained that the forming of <em>bad</em> habits is a
necessary step towards the acquisition of good ones.
We would lay stress on this point, for there seems to
be a real danger in the misapplication of such terms as
‘trial and error,’ ‘the selection of the successful and
the rejection of the unsuccessful efforts,’ ‘practice
makes perfect,’ etc. Misunderstanding on this point
has caused many teachers to encourage, and many
students to acquire, pidgin-speech, and to consider it
as the inevitable or even indispensable prelude to
normal speech.</p>

<p>In the present chapter we are inquiring what are the
processes of nature and how we may train the student
to observe them. We have just seen that there is a
method of theory and a method of practice; it is fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
evident that the latter is a natural process and that the
former is not. We will now proceed to set forth another
pair of rival processes and determine which is the one
followed by the natural language-teaching forces.</p>

<p>When we are young we form new habits with facility;
a new sort of work has to be performed, and we proceed
to acquire the new habit which will enable us to perform
it. When we are older we form new habits with greater
difficulty and certainly with greater reluctance. We
make all sorts of efforts (generally unconsciously) to
avoid forming a new habit, for in some respects the
adult seems to dread novelty.</p>

<p>A new sort of work has to be performed, and instead of
acquiring the new habit or habits which will perform it
we select habits already formed and strive to make them
do the new work. Let us take a few examples in order
to realize what this means. Suppose we wish to make
Chinese characters with a native writing-brush. This
is a new sort of work; in order to do it successfully we
must hold the brush vertically in a way we have never
held a brush before; we must form a new brush-holding
and brush-using habit. But the average European adult
will strive to use the brush and to trace the characters
by holding the brush as he holds a pen; he will be using
the known pen-holding habit instead of acquiring the
unknown habit of holding a writing-brush.</p>

<p>Or we wish to learn to pronounce the vowel generally
represented in French by <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">é</i>. This will require a muscular
habit unknown to the average Englishman. What does
he do? He seeks immediately to replace the required
new effort by a known effort&mdash;and replaces the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">é</i>
by the English <i>ay</i>. If this is too unsatisfactory he will
strive to modify his <i>ay</i> until it seems to resemble sufficiently
the required sound. Similarly, he will substitute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
for French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">u</i>, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">on</i>, English <i>o</i> (as in ‘boat’), <i>ew</i>
(as in ‘new’), and <i>ong</i>.</p>

<p>Or the English adult student may wish to learn to use
French word-groups or sentences, in which case we shall
almost invariably find that he only learns to use those
which correspond most nearly to English constructions;
he prefers to adapt his known syntax-habits rather than
form new ones.</p>

<p>Now children have not this same reluctance to form
new habits, either because their minds are more plastic,
<i>i.e.</i> they are so used to forming new habits that a
few more do not incommode them, or because they are
not clever or intelligent enough to make the necessary
selection from their stock of acquired habits.</p>

<p>Language-learning is essentially a habit-forming process,
a process during which we must acquire <em>new</em> habits.
It is, then, one of the cases where we cannot always
proceed from the known to the unknown in the more
obvious sense of the term; we must often consent to
plunge (or be plunged) straight into the unknown.</p>

<p>The most important thing we have to do, then, is to
train the student to form new habits and to cause him
to refrain from adapting his old ones in cases where we
know that such adaptation will be fruitless. We make
this last qualification advisedly, because there are
certain cases where successful adaptation is possible.
A foreign language is not wholly different from our own
tongue, and where identity exists obviously no new habit
is required. (We must, however, see that the student
selects the <em>right</em> previously acquired habit, that is to say,
the <em>nearest</em> native equivalent.)</p>

<p>The capacity of forming new habits of observation,
articulation, inflexion, compounding, or expression for
every new language is one of our spontaneous capacities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and the student must when necessary be taught to form
such new habits.</p>

<p>Another very characteristic feature of the natural
process is <em>unconscious assimilation</em>; we learn without
knowing that we are learning. What we therefore have
to do is to train ourselves (or our students) <em>consciously</em>
to learn <em>unconsciously</em>; we must set out deliberately to
inhibit our capacities for focusing or concentrating our
attention on the language-material itself. Attention
must be given to what we want to say and not to the way
we say it.</p>

<p>How shall we do it?</p>

<p>In the first place we must set out to sharpen our
powers of receiving and retaining knowledge communicated
to us orally. This may be difficult; we have become
so accustomed to acquiring information from the
written word <i>via</i> the eyes that we feel very bewildered
and incapable when deprived of this medium. We hear
a foreign word or sentence, and this auditory impression
is such a rapid and transitory one that we feel that we
cannot possibly retain it in our memory; we feel that
we require at least one good look at the word so that we
may hereafter reproduce in our imagination the written
form. But we must resist this tendency; we must
discipline ourselves to forgo this artificial aid to memory,
for ear-memory cannot be cultivated while we are
visualizing. If we truly desire to tap the natural
language-learning energies we must obey nature; we
must train and drill our ears to do the work for which
they were intended. If we make up our minds to train
our ears to be efficient instruments we can do so: a little
patience, a little practice, and we shall surely regain the
power that we had allowed to lapse.</p>

<p>The exercises we use in order to sharpen our ear-perceptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
and to make them serve us may be termed
‘ear-training exercises.’ This term may not satisfy
those who delight in hair-splitting definitions; they
may say, “We cannot train our ears, but we can train
our capacities for using them”; but the term is
sufficiently accurate to designate what we mean it to
designate.</p>

<p>How are ear-training exercises performed? There
are several varieties. The simplest of all is this: the
teacher articulates various sounds, either singly or in
combination with others; we listen to these sounds and
make unconscious efforts to reproduce them by saying
them to ourselves. This is the most passive and most
natural form of ear-training; we did it years ago when
lying in our cradles listening to the sounds made by the
people around us. If the teacher systematizes his work, so
much the easier will it be for us who are training our ears.</p>

<p>We must then seek to recognize or identify certain
sounds and to distinguish them from others. The
teacher may write (in conventional phonetic symbols) a
series of sounds on the blackboard and append to each
a conventional number. He will articulate a sound and
ask us to give him the number pertaining to it, or we
may go up to the blackboard and point to the sound we
think we have heard, or he may give us ‘phonetic
dictation,’ in which case he will articulate sounds which
we must write down by means of these conventional
phonetic symbols. This latter process has the advantage
that it can subsequently be extended to the dictation of
syllables or words.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>
<p>Other forms of ear-training exercises may be devised by
those who are engaged in carrying out such work, care
being taken that such exercises do really train the <em>ears</em>
and not our capacities for successful guessing.</p>

<p>If you wish to know to what extent such exercises do
have the desired effect, go through a short course of ear-training
on these lines and you will yourself be a witness
to their efficacy.</p>

<p>Ear-training is not confined to isolated sounds and
simple combinations of sounds; it also includes the
exercise of our capacities for perceiving or retaining long
strings of syllables such as sentences. We are able to do
this in the case of our mother-tongue, and there is no
reason why we should not soon become fairly proficient
in doing it in the case of a foreign language.</p>

<p>The next thing in importance is to learn how to articulate
foreign sounds, singly, in simple combinations, or
in long strings of syllables. We must train our mouth
and our vocal organs generally; in some cases we must
develop certain muscles in order that they may do easily
and rapidly what is required of them. We have learnt
to do this in the case of our mother-tongue, and we can
learn to do the same for sounds which are so far unknown
to us. It is never too late in life to develop a muscle in
order that it may perform the small amount of work
which will be required of it. We must go through a
course of mouth-gymnastics; if we are disinclined to do
so it means that we are disinclined to take the trouble to
tap our natural language-learning resources.</p>

<p>What are articulation exercises? Like ear-training
exercises, they exist in many varieties. We begin by
practising on known sounds. We take simple sounds
and learn to prolong them for a few seconds or to utter
them rapidly, and we practise them in new and unfamiliar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
combinations. We are shown how to convert voiced
into voiceless sounds and <i>vice versa</i>; we are taught how
to produce sounds which are intermediate between two
known sounds; we are shown how to convert known
sounds into their nasal, lip-rounded, or palatalized
forms, etc. We are trained to imitate strange noises of
all sorts, and the phonetician is ready to show us how
to make them. Our ear-training exercises will be of
assistance to us, for it is easier to articulate sounds
that we recognize than sounds which have so far been
unfamiliar to our ears.</p>

<p>At a more advanced stage, articulation exercises gradually
become merged into ‘fluency exercises.’ When we
are asked to articulate a given string of syllables so many
times in so many seconds we are learning to become
fluent, to connect sound with sound and syllable with
syllable without ugly gaps and awkward hesitations.</p>

<p>While ear-training and articulation exercises are being
carried on the student should be encouraged to develop
his powers of mimicry; after having heard on many
different occasions words or strings of words uttered by
the teacher he should strive to become at least as proficient
as parrots and phonograph records in reproducing
them spontaneously. The term <em>imitation</em> is not adequate
to express the process by which he should work; what
we require is absolute <em>mimicry</em>. Sounds, with all that
appertains to them&mdash;pitch, timbre, length, abruptness,
drawl, distinctness, and any other qualities and attributes
possessed by them&mdash;should be mimicked faithfully and
accurately; little or no distinction should be made by
the learner between the characteristic pronunciation of
the language he is learning and the personal pronunciation
of his teacher. The teacher, indeed, should say to
the student, “Don’t be content with a mere reproduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of what you imagine to be my standard of pronunciation;
go further and mimic <em>me</em>.”</p>

<p>Ear-training, articulation, and mimicry exercises will
carry us a long way towards our aim; when fairly proficient
in these, we shall find little difficulty in <em>reproducing
at first hearing a sentence which has been articulated to
us</em>. This is one of our most important aims; once able
to do this, we are able to avail ourselves immediately of
one of the most valuable channels for acquiring the
foreign language; we are able to assimilate foreign
sentences by ear; every sentence repeated in our hearing
will have its due effect in furthering our knowledge of
the language and our capacity for using it.</p>

<p>Anyone who is unable to repeat with tolerable accuracy
any sentence he has just heard is certainly unable to
assimilate the foreign language by spontaneous methods.
He may seek to compensate this inability by methods
involving the imagery of the written word, but these
methods will be unnatural ones and will inhibit the development
of the spontaneous powers. Anyone who
experiences a difficulty in repeating a foreign sentence
which he has just heard will be severely handicapped in
his subsequent work, for he will be paying attention to
his hearing and articulation when he should be devoting
his attention to other things. Indeed, we would go so far
as to say that the power of correctly reproducing a string
of syllables just heard is one of the essential things we
must possess in order to make any real progress in the
acquisition of the spoken language.</p>

<p>It is this power which enables us to memorize on a wide
scale sentences and similar strings of words. Whether
we like it or not, whether the prospect is encouraging or
not, it is quite certain that an easy command of the
spoken (and even of the written) language can only be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
gained by acquiring the absolute mastery of thousands
of combinations, regular and irregular. We shall see
later that certain forms of synthetic work exist which will
enable us to form correctly an almost unlimited number
of foreign sentences; we shall see that the utilizing of
these studial forms of work will carry us very far on our
way to acquire the language; but, ingenious and sound
though they may be, they will not replace the cruder and
more primitive process of memorizing integrally a vast
number of word-groups.</p>

<p>Now this task cannot be accomplished by means of
intensive and laborious repetition work; it cannot be
accomplished by the traditional methods of memorizing;
book-work and perseverance will never lead us to the goal
of our memorizing ambitions. As we shall see later, in
the early stages a certain amount of deliberate and conscious
memorizing must be done; we shall insist on the
daily repetition of a certain number of useful compounds,
but sooner or later we shall come to a stage in which
memory-work must be carried out on a far larger scale
and in a far more spontaneous manner. We must train
ourselves to become spontaneous memorizers, and this
can only be done in one way: we must acquire the
capacity for retaining a chance phrase or compound
which has fallen upon our ears in the course of a conversation
or speech. It is in this way that we have
acquired those thousands of phrases and combinations
which make up the bulk of our daily speech in our own
language. We have acquired the capacity of noting and
retaining any new combinations of English words which
we may chance to hear; we do this unconsciously, and
are not aware of doing so; we rarely or never invent
new types of compounds, but simply reproduce at
appropriate moments those types of compounds which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
we have happened to hear used by those speaking in
our presence. This is one of the habits we acquired in
our infancy; this is one of the habits we must revive now
and use for the foreign language we are studying. So
long as we have not acquired this habit our progress will
be slow&mdash;too slow for the purpose we have in view.</p>

<p>At a later stage of our study, it is true, we may make
such acquisitions by <em>reading</em> instead of <em>listening</em>, but this
will only be after we have become proficient in reproducing
what we <em>hear</em>. We may be inclined to think that
we assimilate new linguistic material by the eye alone,
but this is not the case; the eye alone cannot assimilate.
It may be taken as proved to-day that all normal people
‘inner-articulate’ all that they read, that we are indeed
incapable of understanding what we read unless a process
of ‘inner-articulating’ is going on at the same time. We
need not stop at present to inquire exactly what is the
psychological definition and explanation of this inner-articulating;
we may content ourselves for the moment
by defining this process as a sort of ‘mental repetition.’<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
It is well known that deaf-mute children who have been
taught to read and to write never acquire the power of
writing their ‘native language’ as normally used; they
produce an artificial variety which reads as if it were
written by a foreigner. Nor is this to be wondered at; it
is perfectly in accordance with what might be expected;
deaf-mutes cannot articulate, either aloud or mentally;
they are therefore compelled to learn by studial methods,
and they acquire language as slowly and as painfully as
anyone acquires a foreign language by mere studial
methods.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>
<p>To learn to repeat mentally exactly what we hear,
neither more nor less, without the intervention of any
other elements than those of hearing and articulating, is,
then, one of the things we must do if we wish to avail ourselves
of the help which nature is ready to afford us.</p>

<p>Another of the spontaneous capacities with which we
are endowed is that of understanding the gist of what we
hear without any intervention of analysis or synthesis.
Some people seem never to have lost this power. It
suffices that they should have a certain number of
opportunities of listening to the language being used for
them to be able to gather the general sense of what they
hear. Others do not appear to possess this ‘gift’; they
cannot understand anything they have not analysed and
reduced to its component units. In reality, if they would
refrain from so analysing what they hear (or even read)
they would soon find themselves able to do as well in this
respect as the ‘gifted.’ We therefore suggest that a
programme of this sort should include a certain number
of exercises designed expressly to develop this power of
direct understanding.</p>

<p>What sort of exercises should these be? They are
many and varied. The essential feature should be the
rigid exclusion of all opportunities for reasoning, calculation,
analysis, or synthesis. The pupil must not be
allowed to focus his consciousness on the structure of the
language; he must keep his attention on the subject-matter.
The natural law in this respect would seem to be
that we shall come to understand what we hear provided
that we fix our minds not on the actual words used but on
the circumstances which result in the words in question.
Interest must be present. If you are not interested
directly or indirectly in what you hear, you may listen
and listen for months or even years without under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>standing
what you hear. If, on the other hand, things
are said in your presence concerning matters which affect
even distantly your welfare or which are connected with
your interests or surroundings, you will have a tendency
to grasp the meaning of what is said. We must endeavour
to devise a series of exercises which fulfil these
conditions; we must design forms of work in which the
student’s attention shall be directed towards the subject-matter
and away from the form in which it is expressed.
Gradation, however, must be observed if we wish to
obtain fairly rapid results, we must first work with a comparatively
limited vocabulary, we must use an abundance
of gesture, we must avail ourselves of everything likely to
further our aim. In so doing, however, we must avoid
the other extreme; if we are too careful in our choice of
words, if we speak too slowly and over-emphasize our
speech, the process of understanding will be too conscious;
we shall be fostering habits of conscious study
and of focused attention, things which are very good in
their way, but which are not calculated to further the
particular end we have at present in view.</p>

<p>The most natural form of work, indeed the first form of
work which suggests itself to us, consists in talking to our
pupils, talking to them naturally and fluently, talking to
them about anything which may conceivably be of interest
to them. We may show them the different parts
of the room in which the lessons are given, the furniture,
objects on the table or in our pockets, and while showing
them we name them and speak about them. We may
perform all sorts of actions and say what we are doing;
we may describe the position of the various objects, their
qualities and attributes; we may show pictures and
describe them. These elementary talks will gradually
develop; we may pass by easier stages from the concrete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
to the abstract; in the end we shall be relating (and
even reading) simple stories, and our listeners will come
to follow our thoughts and understand what we are
saying, even as we understood the simple stories for
which we clamoured in our nursery days.</p>

<p>Another form of work, called ‘imperative drill,’ consists
in giving orders in the foreign language to the pupils
to perform certain actions (stand up, sit down, take your
book, open it, shut it, etc.). In the initial stage such
orders will be accompanied by the necessary gestures;
the students will not be slow to grasp what is required of
them, and in a very short time they will respond automatically
to the stimulus provided by the foreign imperative
sentence.</p>

<p>Another form of exercise designed to cultivate the
capacity of immediate comprehension is that in which
we require our pupils to answer yes or no (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">oui</i> or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">non</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ja</i>
or <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">nein</i>, etc.) to hundreds of questions which we ask them,
(Is this your book? Is the sky blue? Am I speaking to
you? Are we in France? etc., etc.)</p>

<p>Certain other simple forms of systematic <i>questionnaire</i>
exercises will further develop the natural powers of comprehension,
of associating the word with the thought. A
type of exercise called ‘action-drill’ will have the same
effect if carried out as a means to the particular end we
have in view.</p>

<p>These then are the chief things to be done once we have
decided to enlist on our behalf the universal and natural
powers of language-using, and these are some of the
various ways in which we may achieve our aim. All of
them are possible and all of them can be carried out in
actual practice by any teacher who has a sufficient command
of the foreign language (and if he has not, we can
hardly call him a competent teacher). Nothing has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
been suggested here which has not already been successfully
carried out by those whose business it is to ascertain
experimentally how languages are actually learned.</p>

<p>The initial stages of the language-course will be very
largely characterized by these forms of work, in order that
the student may be thoroughly prepared and mentally
equipped for the later stages.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="smaller">HABIT-FORMING AND HABIT-ADAPTING</span></h2>


<p>Language-learning, like all other arts as contrasted
with sciences, is a habit-forming process.
Proficiency in the understanding of the structure
of a language is attained by treating the subject as a
<em>science</em>, by studying the <em>theory</em>; but proficiency in the
<em>use</em> of a language can only come as a result of perfectly
formed habits. No foreign word, form, or combination
of these is ‘known’ or ‘mastered’ until we can use it
automatically, until we can attach it to its meaning
without conscious analysis, until we can produce it
without hesitation and conscious synthesis. We hear
a foreign sentence as pronounced at a normal speed by
a native speaker. If we understand this sentence as
soon as it falls from his lips, if we understand it without
being conscious of its form or without even realizing
that we are listening to a foreign language, we ‘possess’
that sentence, it forms part of the material which we have
gained as the result of a habit; our understanding of it is
‘<em>automatic</em>.’ If, on the other hand, we ask the speaker to
repeat it or to say it more slowly, if we claim a moment
of reflection in order to realize the parts of which it is
composed, if we subject it to a rapid analysis or to a
rapid translation, we do not possess the sentence; it has
not become automatic.</p>

<p>We wish to speak; if the foreign sentence springs to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
lips as soon as we have formulated the thought, if we
are unconscious of the words or the form of the words
contained in it, if we are unaware of the manner in which
we have pieced it together, it is certain that we have
produced it automatically, we have produced it as the
result of a perfectly formed habit. If, on the other
hand, we prepare the sentence in advance; if, as we
utter it, we consciously choose the words or the form of
the words contained in it; if we build it up by conscious
synthesis or by a rapid translation from an equivalent
sentence of our native tongue, we do not produce it
automatically; we have not formed the habit of
using the sentence or the type of sentence to which it
belongs; we are producing it by means of conscious
calculation.</p>

<p>Adult students in general dislike forming new habits
and avoid such work as far as possible; they seek to
replace it by forms of study requiring discrimination
and other processes of the intellect. One reason for
this is that habit-forming often entails monotonous work,
whereas the other types of work are more or less interesting;
another reason is that the forming of a habit
seems a slow process; so many repetitions are required
and progress is not at once apparent, whereas the other
form of work has all the appearance of rapidity. We
know, however, that in reality what we have learnt as
the result of a habit is not only immediately available
at all times, but is also a permanent acquisition, and
that what we have learnt by the aid of theory alone is
neither immediately available nor permanent. Let us
take an example to illustrate our point.</p>

<p>We wish to learn when and how to use each of the
German cases. The theory of the declension provides
us with all the necessary rules and exceptions. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
set of prepositions requires the accusative, another the
dative, another the genitive, another accusative or dative
according to certain semantic considerations. This rule
can be mastered without any great difficulty; within
the space of a few hours the necessary formulæ may be
committed to memory, and the student imagines that
the problem is solved for all time. “Whenever I want
to know what case to use,” he thinks, “I shall only have
to remember to which category the preposition belongs
and I shall know what case is required.” In reality his
knowledge of the theory, <i>i.e.</i> his memory of the categories,
will soon become blurred and will tend to fade away;
and even if he does succeed in retaining this fresh in his
memory, he will always require a second or two of
conscious reflection before he is able to hit on the right
case. He will be using consciousness where unconsciousness
would serve him better; if (as is probable) he
has learnt to determine gender by a similar process, his
conscious attention will have to be devoted to this as
well, he will be focusing his attention on the language-material,
which will prevent him from focusing it on
the things he wishes to say. Deciding to use these
‘short cuts’ he will therefore assume for his whole lifetime
the burden of continual conscious effort.</p>

<p>Now, instead of learning and applying theory he
might memorize a hundred or so real living sentences,
each exemplifying one of the results of the theory. By
doing so he would acquire a hundred or so new habits
or automatic actions. He recoils before the task; the
perfect memorizing of a simple sentence is so distasteful
to him; it seems to take so long; he fails to realize
the permanent advantages which he might obtain by
doing it; he chooses what seems the easier path, the
short cut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>It is here that we see the value of spontaneous assimilation.
If the student has trained his capacities of retaining
unconsciously what he may happen to hear (or
read), he will memorize without effort, and without the
expenditure of any appreciable amount of nervous
energy.</p>

<p>The same considerations apply to the learning of the
French conjugation, English pronunciation, Hungarian
vocalic harmony, Welsh mutation, or to the overcoming
of the other obstacles in the path of progress towards
perfect attainment.</p>

<p>The fear of monotonous and tedious memorizing work,
and the realization of the length of time necessary for
each act of memorizing, induce the student to invent
pretexts for avoiding such work. He declares that
‘parrot-work’ is not education, that modern educationalists
condemn ‘learning by rote,’ that the age of
blind repetition is over and that the age of intelligent
understanding has taken its place. He will talk of the
method of discovery, the factor of interest, and will
even quote to us ‘the laws of nature’ in defence of his
thesis. But we know that in reality these are but so
many excuses for his disinclination to form those habits
which can secure him the automatism which alone will
result in sound and permanent progress.</p>

<p>This fear of tediousness is not really justified at all,
for mechanical work is not necessarily monotonous.
Automatism, it is true, is acquired by repetition, but
this repetition need not be of the parrot-like type.
Repetition, in the sense ascribed to it by the psychologist,
simply means having many separate occasions to hear,
to see, to utter, or to write a given word or sentence.
The object of most of the language-teaching exercises,
drills, and devices invented or developed in recent years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
is precisely to ensure proper repetition in attractive and
interesting ways.</p>

<p>Nearly all the time spent by the teacher in explaining
why such and such a form is used and why a certain
sentence is constructed in a certain way is time lost, for
such explanations merely appease curiosity; they do
not help us to form new habits, they do not develop automatism.
Those who have learnt to use the foreign
language and who do use it successfully have long since
forgotten the why and the wherefore; they can no
longer quote to you the theory which was supposed to
have procured them their command of the language.</p>

<p>When teaching the French word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chauve-souris</i> it is
not necessary to point out that this is literally equivalent
to ‘bald-mouse’; and if we tell our student that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ça se
comprend</i> really means ‘that understands itself,’ we are
telling him something which is not true, and something
that will cause him needless perplexity. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hauptstadt</i> is
the German equivalent of ‘capital’ (in the geographical
sense), and we need not pander to morbid etymological
habits by making an allusion to ‘head-town.’ Nothing
is gained, but much is lost, if we tell the student that the
French say ‘I am become’ instead of ‘I have become.’</p>

<p>It may be objected that habit-forming is aided by
these explanations, that the knowledge of the why and
the wherefore is a useful aid to the process of memorizing.
There is something to be said for this statement;
we are ready to admit that in some instances it is good
to point out the nature of the laws that stand behind
the sentences which exemplify them; we shall even
show later in what cases and for what reasons we counsel
the giving of explanations. But we are entirely at
issue with those who maintain that explanations are an
indispensable concomitant of memorizing, and we give a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
flat contradiction to those who maintain that “they
cannot memorize what they don’t understand.” The
most successful linguists have attained their proficiency
by memorizing sentences they could not analyse. The
temptation to replace habit-forming by analysis and
synthesis is so strong that the teacher must continually
react against it.</p>

<p>As we have already seen, instead of acquiring the
habit of using the French sound <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">é</i> the English student
persists in replacing it by some form of the English <i>ay</i>;
conversely, the French student of English tends to replace
the English <i>ay</i> by the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">é</i>. Most of these
acts of substitution are illegitimate; French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eu</i> is a
very poor substitute for English <i>u</i> in <i>but</i>, the English
word <i>air</i> is a mere caricature of the French word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">air</i>;
of the six sounds contained in the word <i>thoroughly</i>
[θʌrəli], only two, [ə] and [l], are in any way equivalent
to French sounds. About half of the forty-six sounds
(or rather ‘phones’) contained in the English phonetic
system have no equivalent in French, and about the
same proportion of the thirty-seven French sounds are
absent from English. Yet most French users of English
and most English users of French endeavour respectively
to speak the foreign language with no other sounds than
their native sounds. The French system of stress and
intonation is entirely different from the English system,
but most English students will use their native system
when speaking French. The average English student
replaces French habits of sentence-building by his previously
acquired English habits, and also attributes to
French words or word-compounds the meanings (or
connotations) possessed by what he imagines to be their
English equivalents.</p>

<p>In many cases he is undoubtedly justified; his efforts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
are not all misplaced; some foreign sounds <em>are</em> actually
identical with some native sounds, some foreign constructions
<em>are</em> actually parallel with some native constructions,
and some foreign words and expressions <em>do</em>
possess an exact counterpart in the native language.
But the trouble is that the student fails to realize in
what cases these identities exist; untrained in observation
and discrimination, he considers as equivalents
things which are not, and fails to identify as equivalents
things which are. French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">a</i> in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patte</i> is frequently not
far removed from a perfectly English variety of <i>u</i> in
<i>cut</i>, but the average Frenchman pronounces <i>cut</i> with
the French vowel <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eu</i> in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">veuve</i>, and the average Englishman
pronounces <i>patte</i> either with the vowel of <i>pat</i> or
of <i>part</i>. The last syllable of <i>pleasure</i> is practically
identical with the French word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je</i>, but the average
Frenchman does not know this, and substitutes some
sort of French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ure</i> or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eure</i>. The French words <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">souhaite</i>,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">semelle</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laine</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dialecte</i> are very similar to the (real or
imaginary) English words <i>sweat</i>, <i>smell</i>, <i>len</i>, <i>d’yullect</i>, but
the average English student does not know this, and
uses pronunciations such as <i>soohate</i>, <i>semell</i>, <i>lane</i>, <i>dee-ah-lect</i>
instead.</p>

<p>In these and all parallel cases the student is utilizing
certain of his previously acquired habits, but unfortunately
he has selected the wrong ones instead of the right
ones; it is for the skilful language-teacher to ascertain
which of the student’s known habits can be most nearly
adapted to what is required.</p>

<p>The same thing holds good in the case of construction,
choice of words, etc. The English student constructs
the sentence <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je marcherai à la gare</i> on the wrong
model; if he must use an English habit at all, he should
in this case proceed from <i>I shall go on foot to the station</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and not from <i>I shall walk to the station</i>. Some may
inquire at this point, “Why drag in English at all?
Why not think in the foreign language without reference
to the mother-tongue?” We would reply that
this is hardly relevant to the matter under immediate
consideration; we are simply showing that the average
student, if left to himself, will tend not only to utilize
his native linguistic habits, but to select very unsuitable
ones. We would, however, add that cases do
undoubtedly exist in which the student would be well
advised to enlist some of his previously acquired habits;
a judiciously selected native form will produce better
results than a badly constructed foreign form.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="smaller">ACCURACY</span></h2>


<p>Let us be quite sure we understand what we mean
by the term ‘accuracy.’ There is, of course, no
such thing as intrinsic or unconditioned accuracy;
the term is a relative and not an absolute one;
this word, and its synonyms ‘correctness,’ ‘rightness,’
and the adjectives ‘accurate,’ ‘correct,’ ‘right,’
‘good,’ ‘proper,’ etc., all imply <em>conformity with a given
standard or model</em>. If the dialect we are learning is an
unclassical one, differing appreciably from the literary
form, then accuracy will consist, among other things,
in not using the literary or traditionally correct
forms. Therefore, if we are learning colloquial French
we shall be guilty of inaccuracies every time we use
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cela</i> instead of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ça</i> and every time we use the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passé défini</i>
(or whatever the present name of this tense may be) or
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">imparfait du subjonctif</i>. Whether the French Academician
approves of the colloquial forms does not
concern us from the moment that we have set out to
learn the colloquial forms. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Du bon pain</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">c’est pas ça</i>,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">i’ m’a dit que’qu’chose</i> may or may not be typical of
educated speech, but if, for reasons of our own, we have
decided to acquire the type of speech exemplified, then
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de bon pain</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ce n’est pas cela</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il m’a dit quelque chose</i>
will be inaccurate as not being in conformity with the
standard we have chosen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Who do you give it to?</i> <i>What have you got?</i> <i>It’s me</i>,
<i>Under the circumstances</i>, etc., etc., may or may not
represent an atrocious English dialect; but we may
decide to teach this dialect to our foreign students,
if only because this is the dialect most often used
by the average educated speaker. Once we have made
this decision we shall consider as inaccuracies such
forms as <i>To whom did you give it?</i> <i>What have you?</i>
<i>It is I</i>, <i>In the circumstances</i>.</p>

<p>When, therefore, we use the terms <i>inaccuracy</i>, <i>mistake</i>,
<i>fault</i>, <i>wrong form</i>, <i>error</i>, etc., we shall always mean
<em>something not in conformity with the type of speech chosen
as a convenient standard</em>.</p>

<p>One of the duties of the language-teacher and method-writer
is to react against the tendency of the student
towards inaccuracy. We shall generally find two types
of inaccuracy: (<i>a</i>) that which consists in using the wrong
dialect (literary instead of colloquial, or <i>vice versa</i>), and
(<i>b</i>) that which consists in using pidgin. Pidgin or
pidgin-speech may be defined as that variety of a language
which is used exclusively by foreigners.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Some
kinds of pidgin (<i>e.g.</i> pidgin-English of the China ports,
the Chinook jargon of British Columbia) have become
so standardized that they may almost be considered as
normal languages; many people deliberately set out to
learn such pidgin-languages, and we may conceive of
the possibility of these possessing sub-pidgin forms.</p>

<p>In connexion with the first type of inaccuracy (wrong
dialect), we should here note that the uneducated native
tends to make too extensive a use of the popular dialect,
whereas the tendency of the student to whom the
language is foreign is the contrary one: he makes too
extensive a use of the classical or traditionally correct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
form. The uneducated native will tend to use the colloquial
form when writing; the foreigner will tend to
use the literary when speaking. In both cases it is
part of the functions of the teacher to react against
these tendencies: to the schoolchild he will say, “Don’t
use a preposition to finish a sentence with!”; to the
foreign speaker he will give the contrary advice.</p>

<p>Having defined the terms <i>accuracy</i> and <i>inaccuracy</i>, let
us now see to how many branches of language-study
these terms (and their synonyms) may be applied.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) There may be accuracy or inaccuracy in <em>sounds</em>.
The student must be taught, by means of appropriate
drills and exercises, to make and to use the sounds of
the language he is studying; if he uses an English
sound in place of a French one, or if he uses a right French
sound in the wrong place, he will be doing inaccurate
work. Ear-training and articulation exercises (as described
in Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">VII</a>) will tend to make him accurate
in this respect.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) There may be accuracy or inaccuracy in the use
of <em>stress</em> and <em>intonation</em>. To use one language with the
stress and intonation system of another results in a
form of pidgin. The student must be taught, by means
of appropriate drills and exercises, to observe and to
imitate the system used by the natives.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) There may be accuracy or inaccuracy in fluency.
Most languages are spoken at the rate of five syllables
per second. Nothing is to be gained by speaking at a
slower rate; indeed, it will often be found that rapid
speech is easier of acquisition than slow speech. Correct
fluency includes correct assimilation or absence of
assimilation, and the requisite degree of smoothness or
grace of utterance; we may often note the harsh and
halting effect of the speech of foreigners who when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
speaking their native tongue are masters of the art of
elocution. By means of appropriate exercises, the
student can be made to observe accuracy in fluency.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) When the student uses the traditional spelling of
the language he should be encouraged to avoid orthographic
inaccuracy. Generally, however, few mistakes
of this sort are made, and these tend to be eliminated more
or less spontaneously. If this is not the case, appropriate
exercises may be devised in order to ensure accuracy in this
respect. Let us note here, with all the emphasis which
is due to such an important point, that the exclusive
use of a phonetic script in the early stages generally
leads to a greater accuracy in the traditional spelling
which is learnt subsequently. We make no attempt
here to furnish an explanation of why and how this is
so, but leave it to psychologists to investigate the subject
and to ascertain the causes of what may seem paradoxical
and even incredible to those who have not had sufficient
teaching experience.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) There may be accuracy or inaccuracy in <em>combining
words</em>; the laws of sentence-building are not the same for
all languages, and the student must be trained to observe
the right laws; he must be taught to be accurate in concord,
in compounding, and in word-order. Some of the
most interesting methods and devices are designed specifically
to react against inaccurate tendencies in this respect.
It is as easy and as natural to say <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la table</i> (and not
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le table</i>) as it is to say <i>latitude</i> (and not <i>letitude</i>); it is as
easy to learn <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je ne le lui ai pas donné</i> as any of the inaccurate
examples of word-order by which the average
English student tends to replace it.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) There may be accuracy or inaccuracy in the use of
<i>inflexions</i>. It is as important to learn the right inflected
forms of a word as to learn the uninflected word. If our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
methods are right, it is as easy to learn the word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enverrai</i>
as it is to learn the word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">envoyer</i>, and far easier to learn
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enverrai</i> than <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">envoyerai</i>. The habit of using the right
inflexions is one that must be acquired at as early a stage
as possible and as unconsciously as possible. Many
methods and devices exist which have been designed to
combat inaccuracy in this respect.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) There may be accuracy or inaccuracy in <i>meanings</i>.
The meaning of a word may vary considerably according
to its context. <i>Open</i> in the sense of <i>open the door</i> has
not the same meaning as <i>open</i> in the sense of <i>open the
box</i>. Most English words have two or more meanings;
the foreign words which are assumed to be their
equivalents may also have two or more meanings, but
the foreign word does not necessarily have all the meanings
of the English word, and <i>vice versa</i>. The branch
of linguistics which deals with meanings, synonyms,
translations, definitions, etc., is called ‘semantics’;
special forms of work have been devised to ensure
semantic accuracy on the part of the student.</p>

<p>The principle of accuracy may be expressed as follows:
<em>Do not allow the student to have opportunities for inaccurate
work until he has arrived at the stage at which accurate work
is to be reasonably expected</em>.</p>

<p>If we force him to speak French before he has been
sufficiently drilled in French sounds, we are forcing him
to pronounce inaccurately. If we tell him to do French
composition before he has acquired the necessary habits
of inflexion, compounding, and sentence-building, we are
inviting him to do inaccurate work. If we compel him to
talk to us in French before he has become proficient in
conversion and similar drills, we are virtually compelling
him to speak pidgin-French and, incidentally, to form
the habit of doing so. In opposition to the principle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
accuracy, we are frequently told that “It is only by
making mistakes that we learn not to make them,” and
that “Only by going into the water can we learn to
swim.” These are cheap proverbs, and we may as easily
coin others such as: “It is by making mistakes that we
form the habit of making them”; or, “He who has not
learnt to swim will drown when thrown into deep water.”</p>

<p>The method of <em>trial and error</em>, to which we have already
alluded, is in direct opposition to the principles of
accuracy; it is the method of sink-or-swim, of die-or-survive,
of flounder-and-grope-until-you-hit-on-the-right-way.
To replace this method by something less cruel
is the function of such things as guides, teachers, and
pedagogic devices. For let us remark that the environment
of the young child who acquires language spontaneously,
as explained in Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_I">I</a>, is such that error has
little or no chance of surviving; the persons with whom he
is in contact are providing him continually with accurate
models of whatever the dialect may happen to be; he is
given no chance of imitating wrong models, and he is not
intelligent enough to create them himself in any appreciable
degree. Furthermore, the young child as a matter of
fact does not begin to use language until he is fairly proficient
in the important speech-habits; he rarely or never
uses a form of speech until he has memorized it by hearing
it used by others.</p>

<p>One of the most important advances in the art of
language-teaching will have been made when the principle
of accuracy is understood, accepted, and adopted by all
who are engaged in this work either as teachers or as
trainers of teachers.</p>

<p>We have seen, then, that there are seven branches of
language-study in which accuracy (or inaccuracy) may be
developed. In connexion with each of these there exist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
methods, exercises, and devices designed to inculcate
right habits and to prevent the formation of wrong ones.
There exist also sciences upon which most of these are
based. The methods dealing with sounds, stress, intonation,
and fluency are based on the data furnished by
phonetics, and without a knowledge of this science the
teacher is unlikely to secure accuracy in these branches.
The (so far empirical) science of grammar is the basis of
those methods and exercises calculated to ensure accuracy
in inflexions and sentence-building. Orthography
(possibly a science, though this is doubtful) is the basis of
spelling work, and the new (and so far empirical) science
of semantics will furnish the necessary data for all
methods, exercises, and devices concerned with meanings.</p>

<p>In addition to these specific sciences, methods, exercises,
and devices, there are general forms of method of
the strategical order, the effect of which is to ensure
general accuracy. As these are practically identical with
gradation, we reserve their consideration for the next
chapter.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X<br />

<span class="smaller">GRADATION</span></h2>


<p><em>Gradation means passing from the known to the
unknown by easy stages, each of which serves as a
preparation for the next.</em> If a student who is
willing to learn and is capable of learning finds his lessons
too difficult, if he fails to understand or to apply correctly
the explanations we give him, if his rate of progress is too
slow, if he forgets frequently what he has already learnt,
and if his oral or written work is characterized by an
excessive degree of inaccuracy, it is perfectly certain
that his course and his lessons are badly graded.</p>

<p>The student’s progress may in the initial stage be slow;
after ten or twenty lessons he may not seem to have
advanced very far; but if he has been laying a good foundation
he has been doing good work, for it will mean that
the next stage of his work will be accomplished more
easily and more rapidly. During the first lessons he is
not so much learning the language as learning how to
learn it. During the second period his progress will be
more rapid and he will assimilate more of the actual
language-material, and he will then be learning in such
a way that the third stage will be still more rapid, and so
on through the subsequent stages; his rate of progress
will increase in proportion as he advances.</p>

<p>In the ideal course, this principle will be observed in
the fullest possible measure; the course itself will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
divided into appropriate stages, each of which will be
marked by an increased capacity on the part of the
student for assimilating and using language-material.</p>

<p>The vocabulary in a well-graded language-course will
be arranged in such a manner that the more useful words
will be learnt before the less useful. (Let us remember
that there are two sorts of ‘useful words’: those which
are <em>useful in themselves</em> on account of their intrinsic
meaning, and words which are <em>useful as sentence-formers</em>.)
The rate of progress on the part of the student will depend
very largely on the manner in which the vocabulary
is graded. Twenty-five well-chosen words will form
more useful sentences than many people believe; with
five hundred well-chosen words an incredibly large number
of valuable sentences can be formed. For detailed
information on this point we would refer the reader to the
statistics which have been compiled by those who have
made a special study of this particular subject. In the
ideally graded course the student first assimilates a
relatively small but exceedingly important vocabulary;
he learns to use it, he learns the more important peculiarities
of each word, he learns how to combine these words
in sentences, he learns the exact range of meanings
covered by each word either singly or in combination
with its fellows. This small vocabulary then constitutes
a sound nucleus, and this nucleus is of twofold utility; it
not only provides the student with useful words, with
language-material which he can actually use, but it
serves at the same time as a sort of centre of attraction
for new language-material. The most apt illustration
of this form of gradation is the snowball, the huge mass
of snow which accumulates rapidly and easily once we
have provided the nucleus represented by the first compact
and well-rounded handful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>The grammatical material must also be graded. Certain
moods and tenses are more useful than others; let us
therefore concentrate on the useful ones first. In a language
possessing a number of cases, we will not learn off
the whole set of prepositions, their uses and requirements,
but we will select them in accordance with their degree of
importance. As for lists of rules and exceptions, if we
learn them at all we will learn them in strict order of
necessity. In most languages we shall probably find
certain fundamental laws of grammar and syntax upon
which the whole structure of the language depends; if
our course is to comprise the conscious study of the
mechanism of a given language, then, in accordance with
the principle of gradation, let us first learn these essentials
and leave the details to a later stage.</p>

<p>Gradation can and must also be observed in the study
of the semantic aspect of a language. If a given word has
several meanings, let us first associate the word with its
more usual or useful meanings. If a foreigner is to learn
the English verb <i>to afford</i>, let him begin by using it in
such sentences as <i>I can’t afford it</i>, and not in such examples
as <i>It affords me the necessary opportunity</i>. If we are
teaching French, let us first use <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ciel</i> in the sense of <i>sky</i> and
leave the idea of <i>heaven</i> to a later stage. <i>I may go</i> has
more than one meaning, but let us first teach it in the
sense of <i>Perhaps I shall go</i>; the other varieties are not of
pressing importance. When we introduce <i>but</i>, let us
associate it with its usual meaning and forget for the
moment that semantic variety which is equivalent to
<i>except</i>.</p>

<p>It is not sufficient for us to adopt the general principle
of gradation; we must adopt the right sort of gradation;
for we can easily imagine all sorts of false grading. We
can imagine a teacher refusing, on the score of gradation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to teach irregular forms before regular ones, and justifying
his procedure by the assertion that the regular is
easy and the irregular difficult. This kind of gradation,
however, is obviously unsound, seeing that some of the
most useful words in most languages are very irregular.
As a matter of fact, in a sound course of study based
on the principle of automatism the irregular forms are
learnt as easily as (and sometimes more easily than)
regular forms.</p>

<p>We can also imagine some teachers maintaining (on
grounds of gradation) that the <em>word</em> should be treated
before the <em>sentence</em>. They would say that it is easier to
assimilate a word than a sentence, that what is easier
should come first. Others might say, “Teach easy words
first and difficult ones later.” But this cannot be right,
for if we observed this rule we should teach a Spaniard or
a Frenchman the English verb <i>to comprehend</i> before the
verb <i>to understand</i>. Gradation does not necessarily imply
passing from the easy to the difficult, but it always does
imply passing from the more important, useful, or fundamental
to the less important, useful, or fundamental.
Now, whatever the true unit of speech may be, our
leading semanticians and speech-psychologists are all
agreed that this unit is rarely the word, but generally the
word-group or sentence. Consequently, to start from
the word is not only bad gradation but bad semantics.</p>

<p>We have heard it asserted on grounds of gradation that
the <em>written</em> form of a language should be studied before its
<em>spoken</em> form. Here again we find the same misinterpretation
of the term gradation and the same fallacy of
‘facility.’ If relative facility is to be the basis of gradation,
then we should teach the geography of Portugal
before teaching the geography of the British Empire, and
we should postpone our study of chess until we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
become expert in the easier game of noughts and crosses.
To learn how to read and to write a language may possibly
be easier than to learn how to speak it and to understand
it when spoken, but this has no bearing on the subject of
gradation.</p>

<p>Another false interpretation of the principle is to
assume that the student will begin by using incorrect or
pidgin-French (or whatever the language may be) and
will gradually become more perfect ‘with practice’ as he
goes on. Now if this is gradation, it is a particularly
vicious form, and in flat contradiction to the principles of
habit-forming and accuracy.</p>

<p>To teach to adults ‘child-like words’ before the words
used by adults is another misinterpretation of gradation.
We do indeed see classes in which boys or girls of twelve
or thirteen learn to recite foreign nursery rhymes, but we
doubt whether any teacher would seriously maintain that
words such as <i>dog</i> or <i>sheep</i> should be preceded by <i>bow-wow</i>
or <i>baa-baa</i>.</p>

<p>Having examined some faulty and vicious manners of
interpreting the term gradation, let us now proceed to
epitomize a few rational applications of the principle we
have set forth, and let us assure the reader that each one
of these has been proved to be psychologically sound.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Ears before Eyes.</i>&mdash;All fresh language-material
should be presented in its oral form and not in its written
form. Sounds should first be practised without any
reference to any graphic forms of representation; the
ear, not the eye, is the organ provided by nature for
recognizing and assimilating sounds. Words should
first be heard and imitated orally, for ideal assimilation
is not helped but hindered when the written form is
present.</p>

<p>Fresh word-groups and sentences should also as far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
possible be first introduced and learnt orally. The adult
student who complains that the process is too difficult
is under the illusion that we hear with our eyes.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Reception before Production.</i>&mdash;It is quite certain that
the student will be unable to reproduce a sound, a word,
or a word-group that has been pronounced to him until
he has really <em>heard</em> the model that he is called upon to
imitate. There is a great difference between really
hearing and merely imagining that one has heard a
sound or a succession of sounds. As a rule we do not
hear what is actually said to us; we merely hear what we
expect to hear. Ask the average foreigner to repeat after
you a word such as <i>und’stand</i>; instead of reproducing
the exaggeratedly shortened form as represented above
in two syllables, he will say <i>understand</i> in three syllables.
As a matter of fact, he is under the impression that he
heard you articulate the three syllables, and consequently
he reproduces what he thought you said. Ask the average
foreigner to repeat after you the word <i>turn</i> pronounced
in Southern English (<i>i.e.</i> without an <i>r</i>) and he
will insert an <i>r</i> because he imagines that he heard one.
The sentence <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il doit venir</i> is pronounced by the average
Frenchman as [idwavniːr]; pronounce it like that to
the average English student of French and ask him to
imitate you; in most cases you will obtain what the
student imagined he heard, viz. [il dwa vɛniə] (the last
word having a remarkable resemblance to the English
word <i>veneer</i>).</p>

<p>The student must therefore not only be trained to
hear, but in all fairness to him he should be given ample
opportunity of hearing the sound, word, or word-group
that he will be called upon to reproduce. Let him hear it
several times, let him concentrate his attention on the
succession of sounds without any regard to its written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
form or its meaning. Let us endeavour as far as possible
to give the student two or even more separate opportunities
(with appropriate intervals) of truly hearing any
given sound, word, or word-group before calling upon
him to imitate the model.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Oral Repetition before Reading.</i>&mdash;Just as oral repetition
should be preceded by a period of audition, so should
reading be preceded by oral repetition. Before calling
upon a pupil to read off from the blackboard or his book
a word, list of words, sentence, or succession of sentences,
let us first ask him to repeat after us the required material.
If he cannot reproduce to our satisfaction a sentence that
he has just heard from our lips, he will certainly be unable
to reproduce the sentence by the process of reading.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Immediate Memory before Prolonged Memory.</i>&mdash;The
teacher pronounces a sound or a succession of sounds
(a word, a word-group, or a sentence). A few seconds
later the pupil reproduces what he has heard; he does
not find it very difficult to do so, for the sound of the
teacher’s voice is still ringing in his ears; in his imagination
he can still hear the teacher’s voice, and he has but
to speak in unison with it. The sort of memory which
enables him to reproduce what he has just heard is called
<em>immediate memory</em>.</p>

<p>Another time the teacher pronounces a sound or a
succession of sounds. The next day the pupil is called
upon (without being prompted) to reproduce what he
heard the day before. He may fail altogether to do so, or
he may succeed. That sort of memory which enables
him to reproduce what he has heard one, several, or many
days before is called <em>prolonged memory</em>. Let us be quite
certain that we understand the difference between these
two extreme varieties of memory. Let us choose a word
in a language unknown to us. Let this be the Hungarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
word <i>szenvedni</i>, meaning <i>to suffer</i>. The word is pronounced
[´sɛnvɛdni]; in the absence of a teacher let us
pronounce the word ourselves three or four times.... Let
us take our eyes from the book, and let a few seconds
pass.... How do you say <i>to suffer</i> in Hungarian?
[´sɛnvɛdni.] Quite correct; we have reproduced the
word from immediate memory. To-morrow or the day
after let us ask ourselves how they express <i>to suffer</i> in
Hungarian. If we are able to answer correctly without
referring to the book, it will be by dint of our <em>prolonged
memory</em>. If this experiment is inconclusive, let us take a
word-group, a sentence, or a list of words; we shall then
realize how much more difficult it is to reproduce new
matter after the sound of it has faded from our ears.</p>

<p>Let us remember this experiment when we are teaching;
when our pupils reproduce correctly (either by repetition
or by translation) what they have heard a few seconds
(or even a few minutes) before, let us remember that we
have so far only appealed to their immediate memory,
and let us not expect an equally satisfactory result when
we call upon them to reproduce the same matter the next
day without prompting. To expect the same results from
the prolonged as from the immediate memory implies a
faulty grasp of the principle of gradation. Let us give
our pupils ample opportunities, on an appropriate number
of occasions, of reproducing matter heard a few moments
previously; this will strengthen their associations and
when later on we appeal to their prolonged memory, the
results will be satisfactory.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>Chorus-work before Individual Work.</i>&mdash;Before we call
on an individual pupil to articulate a sound or a succession
of sounds, let the work be done in chorus on two
or more different occasions. For an individual to have
to submit his tentative efforts to the criticism and perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
laughter of his fellow-pupils is not conducive to good
results. Let the individual pupils test their articulation
in company with others, and when by so doing they have
gained a certain mastery of what they have to repeat and
have thereby gained a certain degree of confidence, let
them proceed to reproduce singly what they have
previously phonated together.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) <i>Drill-work before Free Work.</i>&mdash;This is perhaps the
most important of the precepts to be observed in connexion
with gradation. The forms of exercise to which
the general term <i>drill-work</i> may be applied are many
and varied. Some of them are calculated to train the
student in perceiving and discriminating the sounds of
which the language is composed; others are articulation
exercises; there are also special forms of drill-work which
aim at securing fluency and accuracy in producing successions
of syllables. The question-and-answer method
may be embodied in many interesting forms of drill-work;
there exist also many varieties of action drill,
conversion drill, translation drill, and grammar drill. All
these forms are characterized by common attributes:
they are all systematic, highly organized, and susceptible
of infinite gradation; the work is methodical and proceeds
steadily and continuously without breaks or interruptions.
Most forms of drill-work have been composed and
are carried out in such a way as to preclude the possibility
of the student’s forming bad habits. Indeed, if the work
is carried out as designed the element of error should
be almost entirely excluded.</p>

<p>Now <i>free work</i> in all its varied forms, such as free conversation,
free translation, and free composition, differs
greatly from drill-work, and we can all testify to the
ludicrous results these forms of work yield when performed
by one who has had no previous drilling. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
student has not been put through a proper course of drill-work,
all his efforts at free work will be based on that
most unnatural and vicious of processes&mdash;conventional
translation from the mother-tongue. The undrilled
French student will be speaking and writing not English
as we understand the term, but anglicized French.
Having formed no English language habits, he will cast
all his thoughts in the French mould, and when the exact
English equivalents to his French words and phrases are
missing he will break down.</p>

<p>Free work without the essential preparation means
faulty work, uncertain and erratic work; it means the
formation of nearly all the bad habits which characterize
the average student and which mar his work.</p>

<span class="smaller">PROPORTION</span></h2>


<p>In language-study as in any other branch of activity
we must observe a sense of proportion; we must
pay due attention to the various aspects of the question
in order to ensure a harmonious whole. It is possible
to devote too much time and effort to a given aspect or
branch; this is the case when such time and effort are
spent at the expense of an aspect or branch of equal or of
greater importance. It is necessary, for instance, to give
much attention to the understanding of the language as
spoken rapidly and idiomatically by natives; but if this
occupies the whole of our time we shall be able to do
nothing else, and shall neither learn to speak, nor to
read, nor to write. This would be an obvious violation
of the principle of proportion. It is necessary to know
something of the grammar of the language, but if we
devote every lesson of a three years’ course to the
study of grammar we shall again be offending against
this principle.</p>

<p>We tend to give too much attention to things which
interest us, and too little to those things in which we are
not particularly interested. Such inequality of treatment
is more particularly apt to occur in these days of specialization;
the intonation specialist thinks of little but
intonation, and tends to think that everything else is
of secondary importance; the phonetician is so keenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
alive to the immense importance of ear-training and of
correct articulation that he may tend to dismiss all other
things as trivialities; the grammarian grinds away at
declensions and conjugations regardless of the existence
of such things as sounds and tones; the semantician is so
intent on meanings that all has to be sacrificed to his
special branch.</p>

<p>The most typical example of disproportionate treatment
is, of course, that afforded by the orthographist of
the old school; for him language is nothing but a set of
spelling rules; pronunciation for him is the interpretation
of spellings; grammar is a branch of orthography,
and meanings themselves are largely dependent on the
way a word is spelt. In the present-day reaction against
the orthographist we may expect a swing to the other
extreme, and we may find schoolmasters welcoming
spelling mistakes as the signs of a healthy tendency
towards phoneticism.</p>

<p>Already the reaction against the over-use and abuse of
translation exercises has resulted in an almost equally
grave over-use and abuse of the ‘direct’ method.</p>

<p>There are, however, times when a seemingly undue proportion
of attention should be directed to certain things,
notably when we have to react against a vicious tendency.
If our student is too keenly interested in orthography
and oblivious to the importance of phonetics, we may be
justified in excluding orthography from his programme.
If he is morbidly interested in grammar and analysis, we
may find it necessary to give him overdoses of semantics
and unconscious assimilation in order to re-establish some
sort of equilibrium. With the student who refuses to
learn a word until he sees it written we must for some
time make an exclusive and seemingly disproportionate
use of oral work and phonetic writing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>The principle of proportion, then, does not necessarily
imply <em>equality</em> of treatment nor even a fixed standard
of ratios; it simply means that all the items in the
whole range of subjects and aspects must receive an
appropriate degree of attention, so that the student’s
knowledge of them may ultimately form a harmonious
whole.</p>

<p>It is impossible to observe the principle of proportion
without having in view the ultimate aim of the student.
If his sole object is to become a master of colloquial
expression, our sense of proportion will tell us to exclude
in a very large measure the study of the conventional
orthography.</p>

<p>The ultimate aim of most students is fourfold:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>a</i>) To understand the language when spoken
rapidly by natives.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) To speak the language in the manner of
natives.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) To understand the language as written by
natives (<i>i.e.</i> to <em>read</em> the language).</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) To write the language in the manner of
natives.</p></div>

<p>Each of these four aspects requires special methods of
teaching. A method or device which will rapidly enable
the student to understand the language when spoken will
be inefficacious as a method for teaching him to produce
a written composition. No amount of composition
work, on the other hand, will teach him how to understand
what is rapidly uttered by natives. If (as is
freely admitted) a command of the spoken language is a
great help towards acquiring command of the written,
the converse is not the case; proficiency in written work
does not imply progress in oral work. To pay too much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
or too little attention to any of these four aspects is a
violation of the principle of proportion.</p>

<p>The principle may also be violated by paying too much
or too little attention to any of the five chief branches
of practical linguistics: phonetics, orthography, word-building,
sentence-building, and semantics. Let us pass
them in review in order to make quite sure that we understand
the scope of each and have properly discriminated
between them.</p>

<p><i>Phonetics</i> teaches us how to recognize and how to make
the sounds of which the language is composed; it
teaches us the difference between two or more sounds
which resemble each other, and between a given foreign
sound and its nearest native equivalent.</p>

<p><i>Orthography</i> (with which we may associate orthoepy)
teaches us how to spell what we have already learnt by
ear; it also teaches us how to pronounce what we have
learnt by eye from an ordinary orthographic text.</p>

<p><i>Word-building</i> (accidence and etymology) teaches us
inflexions, prefixes, and suffixes, and how to use them,
how to form plurals from singulars, accusatives from
nominatives, finite tenses from infinitives; most of the
mysteries of declension and conjugation are included
under this heading; the collecting of word-families pertains
to this branch.</p>

<p><i>Sentence-building</i> (syntax and analysis) teaches us how
to combine words into sentences, how to form compound
tenses, phrases, and clauses; it teaches us the places
of the various sentence-components, the nature and
use of concord or agreement; it shows us the differences
between regular and irregular sentences. When
properly systematized (according to a special science
to which the name of ‘ergonics’ has been given)
this particular branch of linguistics shows us how to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
form the largest possible number of sentences with the
fewest words.</p>

<p><i>Semantics</i> teaches us the meaning of words, of inflexions,
and of compounds; it shows us how to transform
our thoughts into language, to select the most
appropriate word or form, and to interpret correctly what
we hear and read. It is more especially this branch
which teaches us the differences in style and dialect, and
enables us to distinguish the colloquial from the classical
and to keep either from contaminating the other.</p>

<p>If we are to judge by the average teacher and the
average language-course, the principle of proportion is
usually violated by teaching:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
(<i>a</i>) No phonetics at all.<br />
(<i>b</i>) Too much orthography or orthoepy.<br />
(<i>c</i>) Too much word-building.<br />
(<i>d</i>) Too little sentence-building.<br />
(<i>e</i>) Practically no semantics.
</p>
</div>

<p>The principle of proportion may also be observed or
violated in the selection of vocabularies and of grammatical
material. To include in early lessons words or
forms which are comparatively rare, archaic, and useless,
while excluding some of the commonest and most useful
items of language-material, is an offence not only against
the principle of gradation but also against the principle
of proportion. Too little attention also is usually paid
to ensuring a just proportion between the various parts
of speech. There is a fairly well defined series of laws
which determine the relative number of nouns, verbs, and
adjectives occurring in a given vocabulary radius, and
with the growing attention which is being given to this
sort of statistical work these laws are standing out more
clearly and are coming to be better understood. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
have also to note a regrettable tendency to give preference
in vocabularies to words of special utility (such as names
of plants, animals, parts of the body, tools, implements,
and such-like semi-technical words) and to neglect unduly
words of general utility, words which may occur in
any context and which are common to any subject.
This is a particularly grave case of disproportion when
we consider that the bulk of any given text (probably
from 80 per cent. to 90 per cent. of it) is made up of
these general words.</p>

<p>Proportion must be observed in determining the
respective quantities of drill-work and free work, of
translation-work and ‘direct work,’ of intensive reading
and extensive reading, of chorus-work and individual
work needed; throughout the whole range of the subject
there are possibilities of good or of bad proportion. It is
for the teacher or for the designer of language-courses to
see that the principle is reasonably well observed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII<br />

<span class="smaller">CONCRETENESS</span></h2>


<p>Such expressions as <i>for instance</i>, <i>for example</i>, or <i>here
is a case in point</i> are fairly common in our speech.
Whenever we hear somebody explaining something
we may be certain that one of these expressions will occur
not once but many times. When we ourselves set out to
explain anything we may be quite sure that in a very few
moments we shall use one of the expressions in question,
and indeed our certainty is justified in almost every case.
The reason for using such phrases is quite clear; every
time we do so it is because we feel instinctively that we
have just made a statement which is not sufficiently explicit;
we are more or less aware that we have expressed
something in terms rather too abstract, and we wish to
reduce our statement to more concrete terms; we feel
the necessity for <em>concreteness</em>. There is a similar reason
for using such expressions as <i>in other terms</i>, <i>in other words</i>,
or <i>that is to say</i>. We feel in these cases that an explanation
just given is wanting in lucidity, and we add a
supplementary explanation in order to make our point
more concrete.</p>

<p>The substance of the principle of concreteness is contained
in the maxim, “Example is better than precept”;
we intuitively know this to be true, and our own experience
confirms our judgment; we remember on how
many occasions a few typical examples have been of
greater help to our understanding than the best-worded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
definitions or the most detailed descriptions. Psychologists
confirm us in our impression and assure us that
it is correct; indeed, one of the fundamental principles
of the psychology of study is that we must work from the
concrete to the abstract.</p>

<p>Let us take a concrete example to serve as an illustration.
One of the things we have to teach the French
student of English is that anterior duration is expressed
in English by the use of the perfect tenses (if possible in
their progressive form) and not by the use of the ordinary
non-perfect tenses as in French, and that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">depuis</i> or its
equivalent is not merely <i>since</i>. The whole point can
be expressed more or less abstractly by the following
formula:</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="left" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><th class="center"><i>French</i></th><th></th><th class="center"><i>English</i></th></tr>
<tr><td>Non-perfect tense + <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">depuis</i> + measure of duration<br />
<i>or</i><br />
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il y</i> + (non-perfect tense of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">avoir</i>) + measure of duration + <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">que</i> + non-perfect tense</td>
<td class="center">=</td>
<td>Corresponding perfect (progressive) tense + (<i>for</i>) + measure of duration.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Non-perfect tense + <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">depuis</i> + term signifying initial moment of duration</td>
<td class="center">=</td>
<td>Corresponding perfect (progressive) tense + <i>since</i> + term signifying initial moment of duration.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>


<p>Now this is a very concise formula and probably covers
the whole of the ground. But it is expressed in such
abstract terms that we cannot expect the average student
to grasp it, still less to apply it in his speech. We can
concretize it by furnishing one or two typical examples.
We can say: “Look at the clock, it’s just half-past
twelve&mdash;we started this lesson at twelve, didn’t we?
Well, it means that we have been working since twelve
o’clock; we have been working for half an hour. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
long have we been working? For half an hour. Since
when have we been working? Since twelve o’clock.
Repeat that after me. Repeat it again. Now just note
that we say <i>We have been working</i>, not <i>We work</i> or <i>We are
working</i>. Now, then, how do you say <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nous travaillons
depuis midi</i>? And <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nous travaillons depuis une demi-heure</i>?
Note that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nous sommes</i> sometimes becomes <i>we
have been</i>.”</p>

<p>That would be a fairly concrete (but not ideally concrete)
way of teaching the point in question. The
average student would grasp the point, and the conscientious
student would probably observe it and incorporate
it into his usage.</p>

<p>But the principle of concreteness goes beyond this; it
does not merely state that examples of every rule should
be given, it specifies various degrees and various kinds of
concreteness. An example in itself is more concrete than
a rule, but one example may be more concrete than
another; let us therefore choose the more concrete examples,
that is to say, those which will create the strongest
semantic associations. Concreteness will be the chief
determining factor in the choice of the early vocabularies;
it will tend to make us give a preference to words and
compounds lending themselves to ‘direct’ work. It will
not, however, be the sole factor, for if we decided to make
an exclusive use of such words it would be at the expense
of the principle of proportion.</p>

<p>Here is another example of what is implied by concreteness.
It often occurs that a student will learn how
to construct a sentence&mdash;indeed, he may even memorize
it&mdash;and yet fail to realize that it is a real living sentence,
an integral part of his linguistic repertory ready for immediate
use. He may have learnt the construction
<i>Would you mind &mdash;&mdash;ing</i> and be able to translate it back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>wards
and forwards and invariably to quote it in his list
of compounds requiring the use of the <i>ing</i>-form, and yet,
instead of using it in actual practice, may replace it by
<i>Would you be so kind as to</i> or some such stilted equivalent.
In such cases we may be sure that the principle of concreteness
has not been sufficiently observed.</p>

<p>The ‘direct methodists’ of the more extreme type
interpret concreteness in a curious way, and identify it
with the non-translation principle and with the principle
of the exclusion of the mother-tongue as a vehicular
language. They tend to think that by keeping English
out of the French lesson, the teacher causes French to be
acquired concretely. In certain cases this is true, but
there are probably far more contrary cases.</p>

<p>In the example relating to the expression of anterior
duration the concreteness consists very largely in pointing
out the difference of usage in the two languages. In
order to make the construction <i>Would you mind</i> perfectly
concrete to a Frenchman, we must insist on its semantic
equivalence to his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Est-ce que ça ne vous ferait rien de</i>. One
of the things we must do to concretize the difference between
<i>I did so</i>, <i>So I did</i>, and <i>So did I</i>, is to furnish the
student with his respective native equivalents.</p>

<p>There are four ways and four ways only of furnishing
a student with the meaning of given foreign units:</p>

<p>(1) <i>By immediate association</i>, as when we point to the
object or a picture of the object designated by a noun or
pronoun, when we perform the action designated by a
verb, when we point to a real example of the quality
designated by an adjective, or when we demonstrate in
similar ways that which is designated by a preposition of
place or certain categories of adverbs.</p>

<p>(2) <i>By translation</i>, as when we give the nearest native
equivalent or equivalents of the foreign unit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>(3) <i>By definition</i>, as when we give a synonym or paraphrase
of the word or word-group or a description of that
which is designated by it.</p>

<p>(4) <i>By context</i>, as when we embody the unit in sentences
which will make its meaning clear (<i>e.g.</i> January is
the <i>first</i> month of the year; London is the <i>capital</i> of
England).</p>

<p>These four methods or modes of ‘semanticizing’ a
unit are here given in order of what are generally their
relative degrees of concreteness. There may, however,
be some cases in which translation will be more concrete
than immediate association. Translation is not
in itself necessarily ‘indirect’ (or ‘inconcrete,’ as
we should prefer to express it); it may be relatively
indirect when compared with good examples of immediate
association, but it is undoubtedly more ‘direct’
than a cumbrous or vague definition, or an obscure
context.</p>

<p>The following precepts may serve as concrete examples
of the way we can carry the principles of concreteness
into practice:</p>

<p>(1) Let the example precede or even replace the rule.
A well-chosen example or set of examples may so completely
embody the rule that the rule itself will be
superfluous.</p>

<p>(2) Give <em>many</em> examples to each important rule. We
have noted that the suggested treatment of the problem
of anterior duration was not an ideal one. In order to
make it ideal we should have taken a second example
(e.g. <i>How long have you been learning English?</i>) and still
more examples (e.g. <i>How long have you been in this room?&mdash;been
living in England?&mdash;been living at your present
address? Have you been sitting here since twelve o’clock
or since a quarter past twelve? How long has France been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
a republic?</i>). Too often the teacher imagines that one
example constitutes a complete exposition of a given
point: whereas in reality it is by finding (consciously or
unconsciously) the common element in many examples
that we come to grasp the usage exemplified.</p>

<p>(3) When teaching or alluding to the peculiarities connected
with nouns, choose as examples the nouns which
are the names of various objects actually in the room,
and in each case point to or handle the object in
question. Handling pencils, pens, and books while
talking about them very much facilitates the grasping
of principles of declension.</p>

<p>(4) When teaching or alluding to the peculiarities connected
with verbal forms, choose as examples verbs such
as <i>take</i>, <i>put</i>, <i>see</i>, <i>go</i>, <i>come</i>, <i>sit</i>, <i>stand</i>, etc.&mdash;that is to say,
verbs that can be ‘acted.’ Present, past, and future
tenses are much more easily distinguished and retained if
the teacher illustrates them by actions. (<i>In a moment I
shall take the book</i>&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je prendrai le livre. J’ouvrirai le livre</i>&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">J’ouvre
le livre</i>&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">J’ai ouvert le livre.</i>) If a Frenchman
cannot grasp the difference between <i>to go in</i> and <i>to come
in</i>, it is because the explanations given to him are lacking
in concreteness.</p>

<p>(5) When teaching or alluding to the peculiarities
connected with adjectives, choose as examples such
words as <i>black</i>, <i>white</i>, <i>large</i>, <i>small</i>, <i>round</i>, <i>square</i>, etc.,
and avoid the traditional <i>good</i>, <i>bad</i>, <i>beautiful</i>, <i>idle</i>,
<i>diligent</i>, etc.</p>

<p>(6) When teaching or alluding to the peculiarities and
semantic values of prepositions choose as far as possible
prepositions such as <i>in</i>, <i>on</i>, <i>under</i>, <i>over</i>, <i>in front of</i>, <i>behind</i>,
<i>beside</i>, etc. Useful work in this connexion can be done
with a match and a matchbox (<i>in the box</i>, <i>on the box</i>, <i>under
the box</i>, etc., etc.).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>(7) Choose as many real examples as possible, examples
suggested by present and actual conditions. Do
not teach the mechanism of direct and indirect objects by
allusions to imaginary farmers giving imaginary oats to
imaginary horses, but give books, pencils, and pens to the
students and make them give them to you, and then talk
to them about what you are doing. Do not illustrate
the active and passive voices by reference to men beating
boys and boys being beaten, but speak about writing
words and words being written or about speaking
English and English being spoken.</p>

<p>(8) In as many cases as possible cause the student to
make active use of any form he has just learnt. When
you have taught him to say <i>I don’t understand</i> give him
an opportunity of using the sentence. If you teach him
to say <i>It’s time to stop</i> see that he duly makes use of the
expression at the end of the lesson.</p>

<p>(9) Encourage gestures, even in the case of English
students. In the earlier stages they should shake their
heads when uttering a negative sentence, raise their eyebrows
when using an interrogative form, and use other
appropriate gestures for such words as <i>here</i>, <i>there</i>, <i>me</i>,
<i>that</i>, <i>these</i>, etc.</p>

<p>In short, observe the principle of concreteness by
using examples, many examples, cumulative examples,
real examples, and examples embodying the personal
interest.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<span class="smaller">INTEREST</span></h2>


<p>We have laid great stress on the necessity for
drill-like work, for mechanical work, for exercises
calculated to secure automatism, for
habit-forming types of work. It has even seemed at
times that we take a malicious pleasure in pillorying and
condemning precisely those forms of work which are
generally the most attractive to the average student.
“The writer of this book,” some may say, “takes a savage
delight in reproving teacher and student whenever they
contemplate work of an interesting nature, heads them
off whenever they approach anything resembling intellectual
work, and turns them into channels of routine and
repetition. He positively gloats over words like ‘automaticity,’
‘passivity,’ ‘mechanism,’ or ‘unconscious
assimilation,’ and apparently glories in the theory that
language-learning like life itself should be ‘one demd
horrid grind.’”</p>

<p>We readily plead guilty to a firm insistence on habit-forming
exercises and drills, but continue to urge in
mitigation that the practical study of language, the
mastery of any form of actual speech, is a habit-forming
process and little else. We must have the courage and
honesty to face facts as we find them: a language cannot
be mastered by learning interesting things about that
language, but only by assimilating the material of which
that language is made up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>But our attitude, far from being a pessimistic one, is
positively optimistic. We are prepared to deny most
emphatically that good drill-work <i>is</i> dull and uninteresting,
and if some teachers make it so it is our duty to
tell them not to. Those who have seen the sort of
lessons that embody the forms of teaching which result
from the rigid observance of these principles all testify
that they are ‘live’ lessons (to use the term they most
generally employ), that the students are keen and the
teachers enthusiastic.</p>

<p>It is only too evident that every lesson must be made
as interesting as is compatible with pedagogic soundness.
Few people learn anything well unless they are interested
in what they are learning. Hope of reward and fear of
punishment are certainly stimuli to work, but very poor
stimuli compared with that represented by interest. If
the method is the machinery of language-study (or any
other study for the matter of that), then interest is the
motive power. Be the clock ever so well and ingeniously
constructed, it will not go without some sort of mainspring;
be the method ever so efficient as a method, it
will not work unless the student is interested. All these
statements are of course truisms and are accepted as
axiomatic; the trouble comes when we discuss the
means by which interest can be induced and maintained,
for we are not all in agreement on this point.</p>

<p>There is, too, the question of intrinsic and extrinsic
interest; the subject may be interesting in itself or it
may derive an artificial sort of interest from some attendant
circumstance, such as the hope of reward and fear of
non-success and all that that may imply.</p>

<p>But a point arises at the outset which deserves our
attention. A fallacy exists in connexion with interest, a
fallacy which is the cause of much error and of much bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
teaching. This fallacy when reduced to the absurd consists
in saying, “We can make a subject of study interesting
by changing the subject of study.” Now obviously it
is absurd to say that we can make the study of French
interesting by teaching geometry in its stead, or that we
can make arithmetic interesting by replacing the arithmetic
lesson by a history lesson. And yet this is the sort
of thing that frequently does take place in some form
or other.</p>

<p>It is necessary that the student shall learn how to
understand spoken French, spoken English, or spoken
Pekingese; it is assumed that the necessary phonetic and
oral repetition work will be uninteresting, so we change
the subject and teach the student to <em>read</em> French, English,
or Mandarin Chinese, or to analyse these languages or to
construct sentences in them by synthesis. Now reading
and analysis and synthesis may to some people be more
interesting than ear-training and oral memorizing, but
whether this is the case or not it is certainly beyond the
point. If we wish to learn to read, let us read; if we
wish to do analytic and synthetic work, let us analyse
and synthesize; but if the object of our study happens
to be the command of the <em>spoken</em> language, it is no use
to amuse ourselves by doing work which does not
further our aim.</p>

<p>“Parrot-work is so monotonous, uninspiring, and uninteresting:
let us rather translate the work of some
author into our mother-tongue.” “I don’t find the study
of the colloquial language elevating: I prefer to work at
the classical.” Very well, we will not quarrel about
tastes, but we will ask you to make it quite clear what you
are setting out to learn and what your object really is;
when we have ascertained that, we will see how we
can make your path an easy and pleasant one. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
journey to London may or may not be an interesting
one, but if your object is to get to London it is no
use taking a ticket to the Isle of Wight or to the
Highlands of Scotland, however interesting such
journeys may be.</p>

<p>The general tendency among educationalists to-day is
towards interesting methods, methods involving the
intelligent use of the intelligence, methods which develop
the reasoning capacities, methods which form the judgment,
which proceed from the trivial, familiar, and
known towards the more profound, unfamiliar, and unknown.
Geography is no longer a process of learning
lists of place-names by heart, history is no longer
represented as a catalogue of dates, arithmetic is taught
by playing with cubes, chemistry is presented as a series
of experiments in the laboratory, botany and geology
are studied in the field. The old cramming process is
being replaced by the method of discovery; the
teacher furnishes the documents and the students
discover the rules; the teacher suggests the problems
and the pupils set their wits to work and find out the
solutions. All of which is very interesting and, on the
whole, very good.</p>

<p>There is, however, this danger: these interesting and
mind-developing methods do not tend towards automatism
and habit-formation; they are, indeed, not intended
to foster any form of mechanical command.</p>

<p>Proficiency in shorthand cannot be gained by any
method of discovery, and the capacity for doing good
and rapid work on a typewriter is not attained by the
heuristic method. Mathematics is a science, but the
absolute mastery of the multiplication table is an art and
cannot be gained by the exclusive practice of playing
with cubes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“The memorizing of the multiplication table is a
wearisome grind; let us therefore make it interesting
by teaching in its place the theory of numeration!”
“Practising scales on the piano is monotonous and inartistic;
let us therefore abolish such finger-gymnastics
and replace all such work by the theory of harmony!”
“Learning sentences by heart and performing these drills
are so tedious; let us therefore reject these forms of
work, and replace them by analysing a text or by trying
our hand at literary composition!”</p>

<p>Now, as we have seen and proved to our satisfaction,
language-learning is essentially a habit-forming
process, is an <em>art</em> and not a <em>science</em>, and if we insist on
considering as a science what is an art we are confusing
the issues and creating a breeding-ground for all sorts
of fallacies. Linguistics is a science, language-teaching
is largely a science, but the practical study of languages
is not; let us remember this primordial fact
while we are endeavouring to make our subjects
interesting.</p>

<p>What are the chief things making for interest? We
suggest six rational and reasonable factors calculated
to produce interest if not enthusiasm without any
detriment to any of the eight other fundamental principles,
viz.:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
(1) The elimination of bewilderment.<br />
(2) The sense of progress achieved.<br />
(3) Competition.<br />
(4) Game-like exercises.<br />
(5) The right relation between teacher and student.<br />
(6) Variety.
</p>
</div>

<p>(1) <i>The Elimination of Bewilderment.</i>&mdash;“I can’t make
out what it’s all about! What on earth is the teacher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
driving at? I don’t understand these new terms nor
the use of them. What is it all for? What good is it
going to do me? I do hate this lesson!”</p>

<p>Have you ever heard comments of this sort? Have
you ever made them yourself? The attitude of one
making such comments (either openly or inwardly) is not
a hopeful one; it gives no promise of successful work;
it shows that interest is entirely lacking. What is the
cause of this attitude, and how can we change it? Is it
because the subject is too difficult? No, surely not, for
some of the most difficult subjects may be most fascinating,
even for the average student; difficulty often adds
to the attractiveness of work and may even induce
interest. Difficulty is not necessarily an unfavourable
factor. But bewilderment invariably is!</p>

<p>There is an immense difference between difficult
work and bewildering work; of difficulties there must
necessarily be many, but of bewilderment there should
be none.</p>

<p>New methods often bewilder those who have become
used to the old ones; unfamiliar grammatical systems
are bewildering to those who think that one system of
grammar is common to all the languages of the world.
It is disconcerting to face the fact that languages have
classical and colloquial grammars existing side by side,
which grammars are mutually exclusive in many respects;
it is more especially bewildering to those who have never
made any study of colloquial language. Easy things and
easy systems are more bewildering than difficult ones if
one has already become more or less familiar with the
difficult system. To those who have wrestled for years
with difficult and tangled orthographies a phonetic
system of writing, the acme of ease and simplicity, may
appear bewilderingly difficult. A good deal of bewilder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>ment
may be ascribed to prejudice or to preconceived
notions concerning the nature of language; this is why
(other things being equal) children are generally less
bewildered than adults when learning how to use the
spoken form of language; they have fewer prejudices or
even none at all.</p>

<p>There are two ways of eliminating bewilderment. One
is to give in the clearest possible way certain fundamental
explanations whenever there appears to be confusion in
the mind of the student; the other is to see that the programme
is properly graded. Once the student grasps the
scope of the particular problem or series of problems, and
once the programme is reasonably well graded, there will
be no more bewilderment and there will be no more
puzzled learners.</p>

<p>We might perhaps add here that there are times,
strangely enough, when the teacher finds it necessary to
induce a temporary bewilderment. Categoric and unconventional
devices have occasionally to be adopted
in order to break certain undesirable associations;
‘mystery words’ and ‘mystery sentences’ often play
a useful part in destroying false associations and vicious
linguistic habits. But these intentionally created
mysteries, puzzling for the time being, are not of the
same order as those hopeless and perpetual mysteries
which are the cause of so much discouragement and
discomfiture.</p>

<p>It is a subject of debate whether we ought to use
explanations at all for the purpose of teaching anyone to
use a language. Some maintain that we should no more
explain a point of theory to a schoolchild or an adult than
we should to a child of eighteen months. The young
child, it is said, learns to speak the language which he
hears around him by dint of sheer imitation; he learns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
no theory and would understand no explanations; why
therefore should we explain at all?</p>

<p>We would suggest that the chief function of explanations
is to prevent bewilderment. It may or may not be
useful for a schoolchild or an adult to know why certain
things are so, why French nouns are either masculine or
feminine, why it is sometimes <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">avoir</i> and sometimes <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">être</i>,
why we do not say in English he <i>comesn’t</i>, why we do not
say <i>I had better to go</i>, and why certain French conjunctions
require the use of the subjunctive. Appropriate
explanations may induce a more rapid rate of
progress or they may not (probably in the long run
generally not), but they certainly do have the effect of
satisfying that instinctive curiosity which, if unappeased,
will induce bewilderment and so cause the student to lose
interest.</p>

<p>We might add (although this is not pertinent to the
subject under discussion) that in the case of a ‘corrective
course’ simple and rational explanations should form an
essential part of the treatment.</p>

<p>With regard to the second manner of eliminating the
factor of bewilderment, viz. the proper grading of the
course, we would refer the reader to the chapter dealing
specifically with this subject.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Sense of Progress Achieved.</i>&mdash;All work becomes
more interesting when we are conscious that we have
made and are making progress in that work. That sense
of discouragement which is so inimical to interest arises
when, in spite of our efforts, we seem to be no nearer to
our goal. Statistics compiled by those who have made a
special study of the psychology of learning show us that
periods frequently occur in which there is no apparent
progress and during which, as a necessary consequence,
the interest of the student diminishes. It is generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
during such periods (technically called <i>plateaux</i>) that the
adult student gives up his study as a bad job and retires
from the contest.</p>

<p>The cause of such <i>plateaux</i> would appear to be a defective
system of gradation; the student has overreached
himself and has temporarily absorbed more
material than he can retain permanently; he has worked
too fast for his habit-forming capacities and has to mark
time until the previously acquired material has been
properly assimilated.</p>

<p>Novelty always gives a certain amount of interest
to a new subject, and during the first period students
often gain the idea that they are making more
progress than is warranted by the facts; when the
novelty wears off the reaction occurs, and a period of
depression follows.</p>

<p>In order, therefore, to make it possible for the student
always to feel he is making progress, and thus to maintain
interest and zest, it is necessary to see that the
course is properly graded, that the repetitions are kept
up regularly and systematically, and that the rate of
progression is consistently increased.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Competition.</i>&mdash;The spirit of emulation gives zest to
a study. The fear of being outdistanced by one’s fellow-students
or rivals, the satisfaction of gaining ground on
them, and the hope of becoming or remaining the best
student in the class is a stimulus not to be despised. This
is really one of the chief <i>raisons d’être</i> for examinations,
tests, and registers of progress.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Game-like Exercises.</i>&mdash;In the case of young students
a considerable amount of interest can be induced by
making certain forms of exercise so resemble games that
the pupils do not quite know whether they are playing
or working. Games of skill such as chess are almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
indistinguishable from many subjects of scholastic study,
and many types of puzzles and problem-games are practically
identical with mathematical problems. The only
danger here is that language-games may not further the
student sufficiently in the habit-forming process; some
types certainly will not; indeed, we can imagine types
of exercise-games which would tend to inhibit it. If,
however, the necessity for habit-forming is constantly
present to the teacher’s mind, it is permissible to introduce
at appropriate moments forms of exercise such as
‘action drill,’ ‘living grammar,’ or ‘sorting exercises,’
possessing real educative value and an interest-giving
value at the same time.</p>

<p>(5) <i>The Relation between Teacher and Student.</i>&mdash;“No,
I don’t take French lessons now. M. Untel used to be
my teacher, but he went away, and I didn’t much like the
man who took his place, and so I lost interest and stopped.
The new man was all right in his way, but it wasn’t at all
the same thing as with M. Untel; he didn’t have the same
way of giving the lessons, and somehow or other I didn’t
seem to get on with him.”</p>

<p>“I like the French lesson; M. Untel makes it so interesting;
he’s got a nice way of explaining things, and we
are never afraid of asking him questions. He doesn’t
laugh at you if you say something that sounds silly; he
understands what you’re trying to drive at, and always
knows what the trouble is. I didn’t use to like French
lessons at all. We had another master then; he always
seemed to be telling you things that you didn’t feel you
wanted to know, and yet when you did want to know
something he never understood what it was you wanted
to know.”</p>

<p>These expressions of opinion (written in colloquial
English) give us a good idea of why two students (one an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
adult and the other a schoolchild) are interested in
learning French when M. Untel gives the lesson.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Variety.</i>&mdash;A monotonous type of drill-work is performed
during an entire lesson. In the next lesson a
second and different type of monotonous drill-work is
performed. The third lesson is devoted to a third type
of drill-work. A fourth lesson consists of sixty minutes of
another sort of grind. A fifth and a sixth lesson are
similarly devoted to two other sorts of mechanical work.
The net result is six dull and monotonous lessons.</p>

<p>Another case. Six lessons are given. Each lesson is
divided into six periods of ten minutes. Each period is
devoted to a different type of mechanical work or drill-work.
The net result is six moderately interesting
lessons.</p>

<p>Not that any lesson should consist exclusively of drill-work
or mechanical work; there is a place in every
lesson for listening to the living language in actual use;
there is a place in every lesson for interesting explanations
and for the factor of human interest, for the use of
devices which usually engage the keenest attention of
the students. If, however, there are forms of work
which generally appear less popular or less vivacious, if
the repeating of word-lists and the reciting of groups of
sentences do tend towards dullness, then we can compensate
for this temporary lack of vivacity by introducing
an extra dose of variety.</p>

<p>A change of work is in itself a factor of interest even if
the work should not be particularly interesting; variety
will relieve any tedium which may possibly be associated
with mechanical work. Let us suppose that on one or
more occasions we do find it necessary for some particular
purpose to introduce an unpopular form of
exercise; we can sandwich that exercise between two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
popular forms of work, and the evil ten minutes will pass
unnoticed.</p>

<p>This point will be treated incidentally when we come
to examine principle 9 (the multiple line of approach);
we shall see what bearing this theory has on the question
of variety and the interest engendered thereby.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<span class="smaller">A RATIONAL ORDER OF PROGRESSION</span></h2>


<p>One of the greatest differences between the old-fashioned
manner of teaching languages and the
new manner towards which we are feeling our
way is a difference in what we call ‘order of progression.’
This term and the principle which is involved therein
cannot, at the present stage of our knowledge, be defined
in very categoric terms; its connotation is somewhat
loose, for it may be applied to the general programme
of study and also to any particular item of study. In
some ways the principle seems to have a close connexion
with gradation, and yet on the whole it appears to cover
other ground, for we can imagine entirely different
orders of progression, and each may be well or badly
graded.</p>

<p>Under this particular heading we have to consider
the order in which the various aspects and branches of a
language may be dealt with. We may conceivably work
from the written to the spoken or <i>vice versa</i>; we may
start with systematic ear-training and articulation
exercises or leave these to a later stage; we may advise
or we may reject the use of a phonetic alphabet; we may
teach or we may leave intonation; we may proceed from
the word towards the sentence or we may take the sentence
as our starting-point; we may exclude irregularities
during the early stages or we may include them; we
may insist on a slow and distinct pronunciation at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
outset and leave abbreviations and shortened forms to a
later stage. In all these matters, and in other cases
as well, we have to consider very seriously two alternatives;
we have to weigh the respective advantages
and disadvantages, remembering always that our object
is to secure rapid but permanent progress. Each of the
pairs of alternatives enumerated above has been and still
is the subject of discussion and controversy; there is
much to be said on both sides, and an argument in
favour of the one side may seem conclusive&mdash;until we
have heard the argument for the other. Let us examine
each of the points we have mentioned and place the
opposing views in parallel columns; for the sake of
convenience we will in each case place the arguments of
the older school on the left-hand side and the modern
answer on the right.</p>

<p>All our experience leads us to endorse most emphatically
all the statements made in the right-hand column.</p>

<p>Numbers of those who were formerly of the opinion
expressed in the left-hand column have become and are
becoming converted to the opposite view; the contrary
case is practically unknown. The modernists are not
arguing in the dark; they have their data and their
evidence, and are perfectly well acquainted with the
arguments of the ancients, whereas few of those professing
the older views have ever even heard of the
modernists’ case, still less given it any reasonable amount
of consideration.</p>

<p>We should note that the protagonists of each of the
two schools are not invariably as sharply and as consistently
divided as in the foregoing comparison. It is
only natural that we should find individuals taking the
modern view in the case of certain of the points quoted,
and the ancient view in the other cases.</p>

<p>An enthusiastic adherent of the phonetic theory will
not necessarily endorse the view that rapid and fluent
speech should precede slow and distinct speech. One
may believe in teaching sentences before words and yet
be unconvinced as to the necessity for phonetics and all
that that implies. Some may favour the memorizing of
sentences at an early stage, but will not agree that the
colloquial language should be given a more favoured place
than the classical.</p>

<p>The two schools, however, do appear to be fairly well
defined, for in the majority of cases it will most probably
be found that those who favour the ancient view in any
one respect will generally favour the whole of the ancient
programme and regard with distrust and misgivings the
order of progression generally recommended by the
modernists.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV<br />

<span class="smaller">THE MULTIPLE LINE OF APPROACH</span></h2>


<p>The ninth and last of the essential principles is, in
reality, more than a mere principle of language-study,
it is even more than a principle of study, it
is almost a philosophy in itself. It seems to be a special
application of a doctrine which, to many, constitutes a
line of conduct, an attitude, towards most of the problems
and interests of our daily existence. This attitude
is fairly well designated by the term <i>eclectic</i>; this, however,
is not an ideal term, seeing that, like so many others,
it possesses a double connotation. Its first sense is distinctly
pejorative; it suggests unoriginality, a lack of
coherent system, a patchwork of other people’s opinions.
In its second and broader sense, so far from being a term
of disparagement or reproach it implies the deliberate
choice of all things which are good, a judicious and
reasoned selection of all the diverse factors the sum of
which may constitute a complete and homogeneous
system. If, therefore, we speak here of the doctrine or
attitude of eclecticism, we are obviously using the term
in its second and broader connotation; used in this way
it stands as the antithesis of prejudice, of faddiness, of
crankiness, and of fixed ideas. Many of those who
practise eclecticism call it the ‘philosophy of the complete
life’; whether this is or is not a philosophy in the
true sense of the term, we will leave to philosophers to
discuss; we will content ourselves by quoting a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
maxims or aphorisms which will serve to make clear the
attitude in question.</p>

<p>All is good which tends towards good.</p>

<p>The recognition and appreciation of any particular
good thing does not necessarily invalidate those things
which do not resemble it, nor even cause us to disparage
or deprecate things which are seemingly in
conflict with it.</p>

<p>Let us neglect nothing except futilities and things
which we have proved to our satisfaction to be in themselves
bad and harmful.</p>

<p>Two or more opposing principles, ideas, likes, operations,
interests, in short any two or more conflicting
tendencies, may be combined, and this combination
can be effected by other means than the expedient of
compromising. Lobster salad and fruit salad may be
attractive to the gourmet, but no compromise between
the two would be palatable.</p>

<p>It is not always the height of wisdom and expediency
to kill too many birds with one stone.</p>

<p>This attitude towards life in general does indeed solve
many problems and vexed questions. It constitutes a
method of conciliating inconsistencies, both real and
apparent. It explains how it is that one can appreciate
both classical and popular music, classical and light
literature, how idealism may exist side by side with a
keen interest in material things. The real and the ideal,
scientific precision and unscientific emotion, patriotism
and internationalism, are not incompatible with each
other in the ‘philosophy of the complete life.’</p>

<p>And what has all this to do with language-study?
What bearing have these fanciful or fantastical philo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>sophical
considerations on the problem of teaching or
learning a language rapidly and well? The connexion is
clearer than one might imagine at first sight, for each
of the aphorisms quoted above may serve, if not as a
definition of the ninth principle, at least as a strong suggestion
of what the principle implies.</p>

<p>Those who have followed us, point by point, in our
enumeration and analysis of the eight preceding principles
may be in perfect agreement with our conclusions, but
may, nevertheless, be sorely troubled as to how they are
to be carried out in practice. On many points there
appear to be conflicts and inconsistencies; in many
cases it would appear to be exceedingly difficult, if not
impossible, to observe two or more of these principles
simultaneously. How is habit-forming consistent with
interest? How can we combine a study of phonetics
with a study of orthography? How can we combine the
development of our spontaneous capacities with that
of our studial capacities? How can we observe the
principle of accuracy and combine it with other principles
which are seemingly in conflict with it&mdash;such as the inhibition
of our powers of analysis and synthesis? How
are we to foster a keen appreciation of the classical or
literary style of composition, and yet concentrate on the
colloquial and trivial? The principles of gradation and
of order of progression seem to reveal inconsistencies
when they are compared with each other; there is more
than a seeming inconsistency between the process of
unconscious assimilation and the principle of concreteness.
Translation is destructive, or is often considered
so, of the power of ‘thinking in the foreign language,’ and
yet it is suggested that the student should do translation
work and at the same time train himself to think in the
foreign language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>These and many other problems or difficulties suggested
by the careful study of the foregoing eight principles can
only be solved by the thorough understanding of the
spirit of eclecticism underlying this ninth principle. We
have alluded to the philosophy of the complete life in
order that we may better realize the significance of what
we may term the complete method.</p>

<p>This complete method, mark you, is not a compromise
between two or more antagonistic schools; it boldly incorporates
what is valuable in any system or method of
teaching and refuses to recognize any conflict, except the
conflict between the good and the inherently bad. The
complete method will embody every type of teaching
except bad teaching, and every process of learning except
defective learning.</p>

<p>The complete method (of which the multiple line of
approach is the expression) is the antithesis of the special
or patent method. Patent or proprietary methods very
often, but not always, resemble patent medicines. We
know what they are. A patent language method, like a
patent medicine, claims to prevent or to cure all possible
ills (linguistic or physical, as the case may be) by repeated
applications of one special device or drug; both of them
claim to kill innumerable birds with one stone. One is
always inclined to doubt the efficiency of an instrument
which is designed to perform too many distinct functions;
a tool designed to serve both as a hairbrush and as a
hammer is not likely either to brush or to hammer very
efficiently, and our imagination refuses to picture what
one vehicle could possibly afford us all the advantages of
a bicycle, a motor-car, a wheelbarrow, and an express
train, not to mention those of a boat or balloon. One
dish, however nutritive, succulent, and satisfying, will
not constitute a complete banquet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us apply the principle of the multiple line of approach
to the solving of a number of vexed questions,
well known to all those who have read or participated in
discussions and controversies on the subject of language-teaching.</p>

<p>Shall reading be intensive or extensive? That is to
say, shall we take a text, study it line by line, referring
at every moment to our dictionary and our grammar,
comparing, analysing, translating, and retaining every
expression that it contains? Or shall we take a large
number of texts and read them rapidly and carelessly,
trusting that quantity will make up for the lack of quality
in our attention and the lack of intensity?</p>

<p>Shall we translate? We can learn much from
translation; it affords us many types of interesting
and valuable exercises. Or shall we ban translation?
For we know that under certain conditions translation
may foster and encourage more than one vicious
tendency.</p>

<p>Shall we memorize sentences or shall we learn to construct
them, both synthetically and by the substitution
process?<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Either plan seems to have its advantages and
its disadvantages.</p>

<p>Which is better: drill-work or free work? The principle
of accuracy inclines us towards the former; the
principle of interest and our instinctive striving for
naturalness incline us towards the latter.</p>

<p>Are we to study with conscious attention or with
effortless attention? In the average lesson or language-course,
the former alone is considered, but the young
child, or the adult assimilating a language under ideal
conditions, knows no other than the latter.</p>

<p>Shall we assimilate our language-material by reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
or by listening to people? Many claim to have mastered
a language rapidly and successfully by the one method,
while many others ascribe their success to the fact that
they have learnt exclusively by the other.</p>

<p>Which is the best method of retaining language-material:
by repeating it aloud or by writing it? There
again, we find many who are staunch adherents of either
method (and consequently opponents of the other).</p>

<p>Active or passive work? Do we gain and retain our
impressions by speaking and writing, or do we in reality
acquire proficiency in the use of language by the processes
of reading and listening?</p>

<p>Without the principle of the multiple line of approach
there are only two ways of settling these and all similar
questions. One is to adopt one alternative, rejecting the
second; the other is to effect a working compromise between
the two. Shall we read intensively or extensively?
“Read intensively,” says one; “No, read extensively,”
says another; and the compromiser comes along and
says, “Read neither very intensively nor very extensively.”
Shall we translate or shall we banish translation?
“Translate by all means,” says one; “Banish translation,”
says another; and the compromiser says, “Translate
a little occasionally, but do not let the translation
be particularly good.” Drill-work or free work? The
compromiser suggests something between the two,
mechanical enough to destroy naturalness, and free
enough to encourage inaccuracy. Shall we memorize
sentences, or shall we construct them? The compromiser
suggests that we should aid our memory by doses of
mental synthesis, in fact just enough to prevent the laws
of memorizing from operating.</p>

<p>The principle of the multiple line of approach suggests
a third and better procedure. Instead of accepting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
one and rejecting the other, instead of adopting the
middle course which frequently militates against the
success of either extreme, this principle says, “Adopt
them both concurrently, but not in one and the same
operation. At times read intensively; at others read
extensively. At appropriate moments, and for specific
purposes, make the fullest use of all sorts of translation
work; at other moments, and for other specific purposes,
banish translation entirely. At times, more especially
during the early stages, let there be an abundance of
drill-work; later, but not before the student is perfectly
ripe for it, let us introduce free work; and then let the
two types alternate. At certain moments, more especially
during the early stages, let the memorizing of sentences
be carried out on a most extensive scale; at other
moments, as a distinctly separate operation, let us cause
the student to perform exercises in constructing correct
sentences himself.”</p>

<p>We have had occasion to note that this principle
suggests the inadvisability of killing too many birds with
one stone. The principle goes farther and adds to the
figure of speech just quoted the two following corollaries,
viz.: “Find the right stone to kill the right bird,” and
“It is often advisable to kill one bird with more than one
stone.” There are many different ways of teaching a
difficult sound, there are many different ways of teaching
a difficult point in grammar, a curious form of construction,
or of causing the student to discriminate between
two things which ought not to be confused. In these
and in all similar cases, there is no reason why several
methods should not be used concurrently; they need not
be strictly co-ordinated. The cumulative effect of approaching
the difficulty from different and independent
angles will certainly secure the desired result. Super<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>ficial
and rapid work on most points plus intensive and
thorough work on certain essential specific points will
generally ensure a well-assimilated whole. Either of
these methods will tend to correct any disadvantages
attached to the other and will be complementary to the
other. The high degree of accuracy which results from
intensive work will tend to spread by contagion to that
portion of the work which must necessarily be done in a
more summary fashion.</p>

<p>This principle, which underlies all others, leaves the
door open for new devices, new methods, and improvements
on the old ones. It leaves us free to welcome and
to adopt all sorts of innovations, provided such innovations
are likely to prove of value.</p>

<p>We will quote one example of what may happen when
we do not sufficiently realize the importance or the scope
of the ninth principle.</p>

<p>The teacher of French may consider that a certain
amount of theory is useful and helpful; he may consider
it necessary to explain all manner of things to students&mdash;how
certain sounds are formed, how certain verbs are
conjugated, why certain constructions must be used;
he may consider it his duty to give information on hundreds
of doubtful or difficult points. And he is often
perfectly justified in doing so; explanations of the right
sort and given at the right moment are indeed valuable.</p>

<p>This same teacher considers also that many opportunities
should be given of hearing French spoken, in
order to train his student’s powers of observation and of
semantic association. This also is good and reasonable;
passive audition, unconscious or semi-conscious assimilation,
immediate understanding and expression, are processes
the value of which we have always insisted upon.</p>

<p>But this teacher, too anxious to kill two birds with one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
stone, combines the two forms of work; he says, “I have
a number of difficult things to explain, and I will explain
them in French; the student will therefore have a double
gain.” The student, however, unless already very considerably
advanced, is not a gainer but a loser; he fails
to understand the explanation, and in his efforts to do so
he fails to adopt the proper receptive attitude towards
the actual language material. After all, we do not learn
how to write shorthand from books written exclusively
in shorthand, and the book which teaches us how to use
the Morse code is not printed exclusively in the Morse
code. To use the foreign language for the purposes of a
vehicular language under the pretext that the more the
student hears of the foreign language the better he will
learn, is a method which stands fully condemned when
we properly realize the nature and scope of the principle
we are now examining.</p>

<p>We may sum up this principle of the multiple line of
approach fairly concisely in the following terms: Let
us approach the language, or any specific point in the
language, simultaneously from several distinct points of
departure, by several distinct but gradually converging
avenues. The observing of this principle will alone
enable us to observe consistently and successfully the
eight other vital principles which it has been the object of
this book to set forth.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<span class="smaller">‘MEMORIZED MATTER’ AND ‘CONSTRUCTED
MATTER’</span></h2>


<p>Until we know more about speech-psychology
and the ultimate processes of language-study, it
is doubtful whether we can embody in the form
of a concrete principle the subject treated in this chapter.
The writer would prefer, at this stage of our knowledge,
simply to submit the following considerations in the hope
that future research will throw further light on the subject
and render it possible to co-ordinate it with those
branches of linguistic pedagogy which are more familiar
to us. Indeed, when we have ascertained experimentally
the exact nature of what we shall call ‘memorized’ and
‘constructed’ speech-material, it is conceivable that the
whole subject will become so clarified that it will be
possible to reduce to one main principle all or most of
what has been said in the foregoing chapters.</p>

<p>Now, whenever we open our lips to speak, or whenever
we set pen to paper, it is with the object of producing one
or more <em>units of speech</em>. These units may be short and
simple, such as: <i>Yes</i>, <i>No</i>, <i>Here</i>, or they may be word-groups,
such as: <i>Very well</i>, <i>I don’t know</i>, <i>Yes, if I can</i>, or
they may be complete and even complicated sentences
containing one or more subordinate clauses. But whatever
the unit may be, long or short, simple or complex,
one thing is clear: <em>each unit has either been memorized by
the user integrally as it stands or else is composed by the user<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
from smaller and previously memorized units</em>. This is a
fundamental fact about speech which stands out clearly
and unmistakably; it is not a fanciful supposition or an
idle conjecture, it is an axiomatic truth.</p>

<p>Now let us term ‘memorized matter’ everything that
we have memorized integrally, and ‘constructed matter’
everything that we have not so memorized, but which
we compose or build up as we go on. Can we distinguish
the two things? In most cases we can. Monosyllabic
words have generally (although not necessarily) been
memorized as they stand; we say and understand the
word <i>cat</i>, because once upon a time we had the occasion to
hear the word in question and the opportunity to connect
it with its meaning and to retain it. The word <i>cat</i> is
included in our memorized matter. Probably most
words of two or even more syllables have been acquired as
memorized matter. Great numbers of compound words
have also been acquired in the same way. A considerable
number of word-groups and sentences are included
in our memorized matter. Such sentences as <i>I don’t
know</i>, <i>Just come here</i>, <i>Pick it up</i>, <i>I don’t want it</i>, are
most probably memorized with most speakers.</p>

<p>Now consider a unit of speech such as: <i>I saw Henry
Siddings between six and half-past at the corner of Rithington
Lane</i>. Is it the sort of unit which we should use as a
result of having memorized it integrally? An actor or
reciter may indeed have occasion to do so, but apart from
those whose duty or hobby it is to memorize ‘lines’ it is
an extremely unlikely specimen of memorized matter.
The writer has just composed it, and does not even know
whether there exists such a surname as Siddings or a
place called Rithington Lane; there are millions of
chances to one that it is an entirely original sentence.
Most of the things we utter or write come into the cate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>gory
of constructed matter; their component parts have
been memorized integrally and so constitute memorized
matter; but the complete units are <em>constructed</em>, they are
the result of rapid and probably unconscious acts of
synthesis.</p>

<p>This is no place for statistics, even if data were available;
it must be left to investigators to ascertain the relative
amount of memorized and constructed matter used
by the young child in his first months or years of speech.
Inquiries of this sort should afford some valuable and
surprising evidence; the writer has had occasion to note
that a French-speaking child of about ten was even unconscious
of the composition of units such as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pomme de
terre</i> or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quatre-vingts</i>, just as the average adult English
person is unconscious of the composition of <i>fortnight</i>
or <i>nevertheless</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> What will certainly complicate such
research work is the paradoxical fact that constructed
matter may become memorized by dint of frequent
repetition. A further complication is added by the
fact that the two types of matter may also be considered
from the point of view, not of the speaker,
but of the auditor.</p>

<p>One of the questions that concerns us at present is to
ascertain what should be the right proportions of memorized
and constructed matter in the initial stages of
learning a foreign language.</p>

<p>Too large a proportion of memorized matter will render
study unnecessarily tedious, for memorizing work, even
under the best of conditions, is less interesting than the
piecing together of known units. Too large a proportion
of constructed matter, on the other hand, will certainly
result in an artificial sort of speech or a pidgin form,
with all its evil consequences. At the present day, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
in the past, the tendency in language-study is to pay
far too much attention to constructing and not nearly
enough to memorizing.</p>

<p>What concerns us still more is to ascertain definitely by
experiment what is the exact nature of those processes
by which constructed matter is derived from memorized
matter. We must find out what really does
happen in the case of young children in the first
stages of their speech-experience, and by what mental
processes those persons called born linguists attain
their results.</p>

<p>There would appear to be three distinct manners of
producing constructed matter; these may be termed
respectively:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
(<i>a</i>) Grammatical construction.<br />
(<i>b</i>) Ergonic construction.<br />
(<i>c</i>) Conversion.
</p>
</div>


<h3>(<i>a</i>)<span class="smcap"> Grammatical Construction</span></h3>

<p>This process consists in memorizing ‘dictionary
words’ (the infinitives of verbs, the nominative singular
of nouns, the masculine nominative singular of adjectives,
etc.) and of forming sentences from them (with or without
the intervention of translation) by means of applying
the various rules of accidence, syntax, derivation, and
composition.</p>

<p>The following is a typical example of the process. An
English student wishes to form as constructed matter the
German sentence: <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ich habe mit grösstem Vergnügen seinen
freundlichen Vorschlag angenommen</i>, from the previously
memorized units <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ich</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">haben</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mit</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">gross</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vergnügen</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">sein</i>,
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">freundlich</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vorschlag</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">annehmen</i>. Besides having to determine
(in accordance with rules of word-order) the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
relative position of the nine primary units, he has to
perform the twelve following operations:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1) Choose the appropriate form of the pronoun of the
first person singular.</p>

<p>(2) Choose the appropriate tense of the verb <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">annehmen</i>.</p>

<p>(3) Derive the present tense first person singular form
of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">haben</i>.</p>

<p>(4) Determine the case governed by the preposition <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mit</i>.</p>

<p>(5) Derive the superlative form of the adjective <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">gross</i>.</p>

<p>(6) Determine the gender of the noun <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vergnügen</i>.</p>

<p>(7) Derive the masculine dative singular form of the
superlative adjective <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">grösst</i>&mdash;when not preceded
by a determinative.</p>

<p>(8) Determine the gender of the noun <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vorschlag</i>.</p>

<p>(9) Determine the function of the same in this particular
sentence.</p>

<p>(10) Determine the form of the possessive adjective
of the third person masculine singular when
modifying a masculine accusative singular noun.</p>

<p>(11) Determine the form of the adjective <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">freundlich</i>
when preceded by a possessive adjective and
when modifying a masculine accusative noun.</p>

<p>(12) Derive the past participle <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">angenommen</i> from the
infinitive.</p></div>

<p>It will be noticed that most of these operations require,
in addition to a perfect memory of the grammatical
rules (including numbers of word-lists), a fine power of
logical discrimination. Needless to say, no speaker
of German actually does perform any of these operations
(except perhaps on very special and rare occasions),
and we dismiss as a patent absurdity the
supposition that the young native child constructs his
matter in any such way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>


<h3>(<i>b</i>) <span class="smcap">Ergonic Construction</span></h3>

<p>In this process we work from an entirely different sort
of memorized matter; instead of being merely ‘dictionary
words’ it consists of (<i>a</i>) more or less complete
sentences, and (<i>b</i>) units of speech which we may term
‘ergons,’ <i>i.e.</i> ‘working units’ derived and inflected in
advance by the teacher (or the author of the course), each
ergon being thus quite ready for use.</p>

<p>The following is a typical example of the process:</p>

<p>A fairly simple sentence is memorized; let us say, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ich
kann meinen Stock heute nicht nehmen</i>, “I can’t take
my stick to-day.” Appropriate groups of ergons are also
memorized, such as:</p>

<div class="blockquot" lang="de" xml:lang="de">
<p>
<span class="letter">A</span><br />
ich, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">I</i><br />
<br />
<span class="letter">B</span><br />
kann, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">can</i><br />
muss, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">must</i><br />
soll, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">am to</i><br />
werde, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">shall</i><br />
könnte, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">could</i><br />
musste, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">had to</i><br />
sollte, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">ought to</i><br />

<br />
<span class="letter">C</span><br />
meinen Stock, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">my stick</i><br />
meinen Bleistift, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">my pencil</i><br />
Ihren Regenschirm, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">your umbrella</i><br />
den Stuhl, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">the chair</i><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>denselben, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">the same</i><br />
ihn, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">him</i>, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">it</i><br />
sie, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">her</i>, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">it</i><br />
es, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">it</i><br />
<br />
<span class="letter">D</span><br />
heute, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">to-day</i><br />
morgen, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">to-morrow</i><br />
heute morgen, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">this morning</i><br />
morgen früh, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">to-morrow morning</i><br />
um zwei Uhr, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">at two o’clock</i><br />
nächsten Monat, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">next month</i><br />
nächste Woche, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">next week</i><br />
nächstes Jahr, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">next year</i><br />
<br />
<span class="letter">E</span><br />
nicht, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">not</i><br />
<br />
<span class="letter">F</span><br />

suchen, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">look for</i><br />
finden, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">find</i><br />
bekommen, <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">get</i>
</p>

</div>

<p>The student will then form (as constructed matter) as
many of the 16,128 resultant sentences<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> as is considered
necessary for this particular vocabulary. This will be
done by means of drills and habit-forming exercises based
on the following substitution table:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>



<div class="center">
<table class="left" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><th class="center">A</th><th class="center">B</th><th class="center">C</th><th class="center">D</th><th class="center">E</th><th class="center">F</th></tr>
<tr><td>Ich</td><td>kann</td><td>meinen Stock</td><td>heute</td><td>nicht</td><td>nehmen</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>muss</td><td>meinen Bleistift</td><td>morgen</td><td></td><td>sehen</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>soll</td><td>Ihren Regenschirm</td><td>heute morgen</td><td></td><td>bringen</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>werde</td><td>den Stuhl</td><td>morgen früh</td><td></td><td>tragen</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>könnte</td><td>denselben</td><td>um zwei Uhr</td><td></td><td>suchen</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>musste</td><td>ihn</td><td>nächsten Monat</td><td></td><td>finden</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>sollte</td><td>sie</td><td>nächste Woche</td><td></td><td>bekommen</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>würde</td><td>es</td><td>nächstes Jahr</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The essential difference between grammatical and
ergonic construction lies in the sort of memorized matter
used in either case. In grammatical construction the
memorized matter consists exclusively of what we have
called ‘dictionary words’ (a large proportion of which
require modifying in some form or other before being
available for use in a sentence), whereas in ergonic construction
two sorts of memorized matter are required:
a more or less complete sentence and a number of ergons
(units of language inflected or composed in advance for
the student, instead of by the student).</p>


<h3>(<i>c</i>) <span class="smcap">Conversion</span></h3>

<p>This process consists in memorizing a number
of sentences all composed in a more or less uniform
way.</p>

<p>When these sentences have been memorized, the
student is taught by a series of appropriate drills and
habit-forming exercises to convert each sentence into
another form.</p>

<p>The following is a typical example of the process. The
student memorizes the ten following sentences:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
(1) <i>He goes to the station.</i><br />
(2) <i>He comes here.</i><br />
(3) <i>He takes it.</i><br />
(4) <i>He waits for it.</i><br />
(5) <i>He stays there.</i><br />
(6) <i>He writes a letter.</i><br />
(7) <i>He reads a book.</i><br />
(8) <i>He speaks French.</i><br />
(9) <i>He gets up.</i><br />
(10) <i>He’s here.</i><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>He then listens to the teacher, who says:</p>


<table class="left lefttable" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td><i>He goes to the station</i></td><td><i>He doesn’t go to the station.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><i>He comes here</i></td><td><i>He doesn’t come here.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>etc.</td><td>etc.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>and after one or more repetitions performs the conversion
himself in the same way, with or without prompting by
the teacher or the book.</p>

<p>The teacher will then change the sentences in some
other manner, for instance:</p>


<table class="lefttable" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td><i>He goes to the station</i></td><td><i>Does he go to the station?</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><i>He comes here</i></td><td><i>Does he come here?</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>etc.</td><td>etc.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The student listens, and subsequently performs the same
series. On other occasions each of the ten sentences may
be converted into forms such as:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>He’ll go to the station</i>, etc.<br />
<i>He wants to go to the station</i>, etc.<br />
<i>He’s going to the station</i>, etc.<br />
<i>He didn’t go to the station</i>, etc.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span><i>He went to the station</i>, etc.<br />
<i>He’s gone to the station</i>, etc.<br />
<i>It’s impossible for him to go to the station</i>, etc.<br />
<i>He always goes to the station</i>, etc.
</p>
</div>

<p>In the case of conversion the difference between memorized
and constructed matter is not so marked as in the
two synthetic operations, nor is the yield of constructed
matter so great. Indeed, in extreme cases, the form into
which the original sentence is to be converted will have
to be learnt integrally, and so becomes in itself memorized
matter. On the other hand, some forms of this type of
work are practically identical with exercises based on
ergonic construction, and for these two reasons it has
been held that conversion is not a distinct process for
forming constructed matter, but merely a modified form
of ergonic work. Whether this view is justified or not
is a matter more of academic than of practical interest
to the language-teacher.</p>

<p>These then appear to be the only three processes
known by which memorized matter can be developed and
expanded into original composition. What we have called
grammatical construction is the classical and almost
universal method. What we have called ergonic construction
is embodied more or less unsystematically in a
number of language-courses and the more enlightened
books of instruction. Conversion is also practised, but
still in a sporadic and desultory fashion.</p>

<p>Now, some thirty years ago the reform movement
started. In several different countries bands of zealous
pioneers took up arms against the then prevailing system
and sought to put an end to it. The reform prospered.
The reformers have carried all before them, and the daring
innovators of twenty or thirty years ago now enjoy the
prestige that their efforts have earned for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>What was the nature of this reform? What abuses
has it swept away? And for what innovations have we
to thank it? It would appear, on analysis, to have had
a threefold object:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>a</i>) To promote the rational and systematic study of
pronunciation by means of phonetic theory and
transcription.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) To promote the idea that a language is used primarily
as a means of communicating thoughts.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) To promote the idea that foreign languages should
be learned by methods approximating to those
by which we learn our native tongue.</p></div>

<p>The first two objects have certainly been attained;
phonetics is the order of the day, and both teachers and
students have to use phonetic symbols whether they like
it or not; moreover, the new generation does recognize
that the deciphering and analysis of ancient texts is not
the primary use of language.</p>

<p>The third object has not been so successfully pursued;
indeed, we are still very far from learning the foreign
tongue by the same processes as those by which we learnt
our own. The chief reason for this failure was a bad
diagnosis of the chief evils of the system hitherto employed.
Many of the reformers and most of their
disciples imagined ‘translation’ to be the root of the evil,
and so translation in every shape or form was banned;
there must be no bilingualism at all, and so the mother-tongue
must be excluded from the course, the lessons
must be conducted entirely in the foreign language.</p>

<p>But translation and the use of the mother-tongue, as it
turns out, are perfectly harmless and in many cases
positively beneficial; the evil lay in the exaggerated
attention which had always been paid to grammatical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
construction; that was the dragon that the St Georges
might well have slain had not the red herring of ‘translation’
unfortunately been drawn across the track. As it
was, the red herring was duly run down and annihilated,
and the dragon still lives!</p>

<p>The misunderstanding was natural enough; logicians
would quote it as an example of the fallacy of the False
Cause. The process of grammatical construction was
carried out by means of a vicious form of translation
exercise, and the result was utterly bad. Two important
reforms might have been effected: in the first place, the
vicious form of translation might have been replaced by
a beneficial form; and secondly, new and more worthy uses
of translation might have been found. But the act of
translation itself (nay, the mere use of the mother-tongue)
was made the scapegoat and so paid the penalty. It is
now time for a second band of reformers to attack and to
destroy the original cause of unsuccessful language-study,
viz. grammatical construction, or at any rate to limit it
to special cases and to appropriate occasions. It is time,
too, to rehabilitate in some measure the character of the
comparatively innocent process of translation, and to
remove the stigma attached to those who still use the
mother-tongue as a vehicular language, and by so
doing proceed naturally enough from the known to
the unknown.</p>

<p>These are no reactionary suggestions; they are made
in the spirit of the nine essential principles treated in the
previous chapters, and are not in contradiction to the
urgent plea set forth in these pages for the recognition
and fostering of our ‘spontaneous’ capacities for language-study.
We can afford to ignore no necessary tool
in our efforts to teach well and to produce perfect results,
and translation is often a necessary tool, especially during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the process of deriving constructed from memorized
matter.</p>

<p>We suggest for the moment no tenth principle based
on these considerations; we submit the problem and we
more than hint at a solution. It is now time for experimental
work on ‘ergonic’ lines, and the data to be
obtained thereby will enable us to form our conclusions
and to embody them among the principles of language-study.</p>
